abash,cause to be embarrassed,"Although abash sounds like a big party or what firefighters do to get through a locked door, abash is, in fact, a verb that means you have caused another person to feel awkward, bashful, embarrassed, or ashamed.","To make your best friend feel abashed, you might tell her new boyfriend about the time she... but why would you want to embarrass her? Typically abash is used when something has a shaming effect. You might find yourself saying: “I was abashed by the magnitude of the others’ generosity so I donated twenty thousand more,” but you wouldn’t just use abash in place of embarrass. It would sound strange to warn, “Don’t do that, you’re going to abash yourself!”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abash
abate,become less in amount or intensity,Something that abates becomes fewer or less intense. Your enthusiasm for skiing might abate after falling off a ski lift and getting a mouthful of snow.,"Abate comes from the Old French verb abattre, ""to beat down,"" and means to reduce or become less intense or numerous. As an intransitive verb, it is often used with something physically, emotionally, or figuratively violent, as in ""the flood of fan mail began to abate."" Using it transitively, if you take measures to abate pollution or noise, you reduce them. Pronounce abate with the stress on the second syllable (uh-BATE).",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abate
abdicate,"give up, such as power, as of monarchs and emperors","Sometimes someone in power might decide to give up that power and step down from his or her position. When they do that, they abdicate their authority, giving up all duties and perks of the job.","The original meaning of the verb abdicate came from the combination of the Latin ab- ""away"" and dicare ""proclaim."" (Note that in the charming relationships between languages with common roots, the Spanish word for ""he says"" is dice, which comes directly from dicare.) The word came to refer to disowning one's children, and it wasn't until the 17th century that the first use of the word relating to giving up power or public office was recorded.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abdicate
aberration,a state or condition markedly different from the norm,"An aberration is something strange that rarely occurs. An example of an aberration is when the temperature hits 90 degrees in January — it's nice and warm, but it's really strange.","The noun aberration often refers to something that doesn't fit with current moral standards, or is something that shows a mental lack of control. Aberration comes from the Latin word that means ""to wander, go astray."" Today, you'd say it was an aberration to send little children to work in coal mines and factories and not to school, which was common in the nineteenth century. There's a very old poem called ""The Chimney Sweep"" about a boy who cleans chimneys and is only about five years old!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/aberration
abhor,find repugnant,"If you abhor something, it gives you a feeling of complete hatred. Chances are you abhor that kid who used to torture the frogs in biology class.","Abhor is from Latin abhorrere — ""to shrink back in horror."" It is the strongest way in English to express hatred, even stronger than loathe. We only use abhor in formal contexts; you might say ""I abhor that man,"" but you would be less likely to say ""I abhor spinach"" unless you tend to express yourself in highfalutin terms no matter what the occasion.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abhor
abject,of the most contemptible kind,"If it reeks of humiliation or looks like the lowest of lows, then you can safely describe it as abject.","The pronunciation of abject is up for debate: you can decide whether to stress the first or the second syllable. But what's more important is understanding how extreme this adjective is. Abject means absolutely miserable, the most unfortunate, with utter humiliation. You might have heard the phrase abject poverty, which is the absolute worst, most hopeless level of poverty you've ever seen.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abject
abnegate,deny or renounce,The verb abnegate means to deny or renounce something. Scientists abnegate the existence of little green spacemen from Mars.,"The verb abnegate also means to surrender a position of power. If you serve on too many committees, you may need to cut back. You could abnegate the treasurer position for P.T.A., in order to have more time to serve as president of Band Boosters. What's the difference between abnegate and abdicate? Both mean to renounce power or authority, but abdicate is usually reserved for higher offices of power. The king abdicates the throne. The CEO, who gives up day-to-day responsibility? He abnegates responsibility.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abnegate
abortive,failing to accomplish an intended result,"Did you ever start something and not finish it? If so, that was an abortive project. Abortive things don't get finished.","Abortive is a variation of abort, which means to end something, so something abortive never reaches its end point. If you tried like crazy to run a marathon but couldn't finish, your efforts were abortive. If someone tripped you during the marathon, their efforts were abortive too. Abortive things always lead to the words ""The end."" Abortive can also be a way of avoiding the word unsuccessful.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abortive
abridge,"lessen, diminish, or curtail","So the editor wants to cut your epic 800-page history of the stapler to a 150-page summary instead. Don't cry — he just wants to abridge your masterpiece, trimming it down to the more readable essential elements.","Synonymous with abbreviate, condense and cut short, abridge comes from the Latin word abreviare, which means ""to shorten."" Although it's usually used in reference to wordy texts, one can also abridge or shorten a piece of clothing; a miniskirt is just an abridged version of the old floor length hoop skirt, for example. But abridging something isn't always good: If your civil rights are abridged, they've been lessened in some way.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abridge
absolute,perfect or complete or pure,"Use absolute as a noun or an adjective when you're so sure of something that you know it will never change. For example, a devout person's belief in life after death is an absolute; that person has absolute faith in the afterlife.","Absolute can also mean ""without any doubt,"" as in the case of an absolute beauty — such as a glamorous movie star or a supermodel — or ""without limits,"" such as a dictator who has absolute power over the people. Or, absolute can describe a final demand that must be met, such as the absolute conditions a person buying a home might present to its seller — it's the last step and can make or break the sale.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/absolute
absolve,grant remission of a sin to,"To be absolved is to be let off the hook, to be set free from a certain obligation or to be forgiven for a wrongdoing. The Church may absolve you of your sins, but that won't absolve you of the need to attend mass.","The Latin absolvere, which means ""to set free,"" is the root of the word absolve. In the religious sense, to be absolved means to be truly forgiven in the eyes of the Lord, which must feel like being set free. In a more mundane everyday usage, absolve can be used to describe being let off the hook. For instance, putting a campaign poster in your window does not absolve you of the responsibility to vote.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/absolve
abstinent,self-restraining,"Someone who's abstinent is moderate and restrained, especially when it comes to consuming food and drink. A person who quits drinking alcohol completely is abstinent.","It's most common to use the adjective abstinent to describe someone who has given up using alcohol or other intoxicants, but you can also use it to talk about a person who's self-restrained in other ways. You might say, ""No dessert for me — I'm trying to be abstinent this month!"" Abstinent is an Old French word meaning ""moderate"" or ""modest,"" from the Latin abstinere, ""to refrain from.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abstinent
abstract,existing only in the mind,Use the adjective abstract for something that is not a material object or is general and not based on specific examples.,"Abstract is from a Latin word meaning ""pulled away, detached,"" and the basic idea is of something detached from physical, or concrete, reality. It is frequently used of ideas, meaning that they don't have a clear applicability to real life, and of art, meaning that it doesn't pictorially represent reality. It is also used as a noun, especially in the phrase ""in the abstract"" (a joke has a person laying down a new sidewalk saying ""I like little boys in the abstract, but not in the concrete""), and as a verb (accented on the second syllable), meaning ""to remove.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abstract
abstruse,difficult to understand,Abstruse things are difficult to understand because they are so deep and intellectually challenging. It might be hard to figure out how a toilet flushes but the technology that goes into making the Internet function is abstruse.,"The Latin roots of the word abstruse are about concealing or hiding something, which is a good way to remember the meaning of this word. It is useful when describing something that is overly confusing, or if someone is deliberately making a story or a situation more complicated than necessary. It sounds and looks like obtuse, but abstruse is almost its opposite. Obtuse is dull or lacking a sharpness of intellect. While Abstruse is president of the chess club, Obtuse is hanging out by the parking lot smoking cigarettes.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abstruse
abysmal,so deep as to be immeasurable,"If you want to say something is really, really bad — then call it abysmal. If one person shows up to your party, well then that is an abysmal turnout. The 1958 Ford Edsel? An abysmal failure.","When someone describes the hole you just dug as abysmal, you may not know whether to take it as positive or negative feedback. That's because starting in the 1650s, abysmal simply meant “resembling an abyss in depth.” By that definition you've just received a compliment on your deep digging skills. But since the early twentieth century, abysmal has been more commonly used to identify something as ""extremely bad."" So it's more likely that your hole has just been insulted.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abysmal
accolade,a tangible symbol signifying approval or distinction,"A knight being honored with the tap of a sword-blade was the earliest form of accolade. Today, an accolade is more than a way to bestow knighthood, it is a form of praise or an award.","In the early 17th century, the French accoler meant to ""embrace the neck,"" which was done as part of a knighthood ceremony. By the 19th century, accolade came to mean ""award."" A person who achieves a goal in research or service may receive an official paper certificate or trophy, an accolade of achievement, while a performer or speaker might get an accolade in the form of applause from the audience. Rarely does either of these types of accolade involve a sword.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/accolade
accost,approach and speak to someone aggressively or insistently,To accost is to approach someone aggressively or confront them in an inappropriate way.,"Accost describes a confrontation — one that's often aggressive in nature. You're likely to be accosted by angry picketers if you wear your finest fur coat to a march against animal cruelty. The paparazzi make their living by accosting celebrities, pushing in close to snap candid photos as the stars leave their limos.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/accost
acerbic,sour or bitter in taste,"If you say something acerbic, or harshly bitter, to someone, it can leave a bitter taste in your own mouth that lingers, and the acerbic, or acidic, words can eat away at the person on the receiving end too.","It is fitting that the first part of acerbic sounds like the first part of ""acid,"" because the Latin source of acerbic is acerbus, ""sour-tasting."" Acerbic speech is like acid, because it is sour and corrodes, or weakens, relationships. There are ways to use sharp words for humor, and some comedians are known for their ""acerbic wit,"" but just as you would take safety precautions in using acid in a science lab, you should be cautious about using acerbic language in conversation.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/acerbic
acquiesce,agree or express agreement,"To acquiesce is to agree to something or to give in. If your kid sister is refusing to hand over the television remote, you hope she acquiesces before your favorite show comes on.","The verb acquiesce comes from the Latin word acquiescere, meaning “to rest.” If you “rest” or become passive in the face of something to which you object, you are giving tacit agreement. In other words, you acquiesce. If you want to go hiking with your family and your children are not interested, it will be a very tough day on the trail until they acquiesce.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/acquiesce
acrid,"strong and sharp, as a taste or smell","Acrid is almost always used to describe a smell, and it ain't a pretty one. Acrid is the nasty sting that you feel in your nose when you walk by a building that just burned down — it's sulfur mixed with smoke.","You can also use acrid to describe someone's tone or general demeanor when they are being nasty. Someone about to do something evil might first give an acrid sneer, or speak in a chillingly acrid tone of voice, or even shudder as if they'd just bit into something with an acrid taste.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/acrid
acrimonious,marked by strong resentment or cynicism,"Locked in a mean-spirited, bitter argument? That's an acrimonious situation that might result in fists flying unless you and your opponent can cool down.","If you're familiar with the adjective acrid, which means ""having a strongly unpleasant taste or smell,"" you might guess that acrimonious probably refers to something unpleasant, too. And you'd be right. Until the mid-nineteenth century, acrimonious meant the same thing as acrid. But while acrid is still most commonly used in a literal sense (as in ""an acrid odor""), acrimonious is now used to describe things like angry and bitter speeches or debates. Both words come to English from the Latin word acer, meaning ""sharp."" Keep sharp objects locked up if a showdown gets too acrimonious.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/acrimonious
acumen,shrewdness shown by keen insight,"If you have acumen, you are very sharp at what you do. You hope your accountant and your surgeon are both known for their acumen.","The noun acumen comes from the Latin word acumen, meaning “a point,” or “sting.” If you are able to make pointed decisions, if you have a sharp intellect, if you make good strategic moves, if you are successful in your field, or if your business instincts are spot-on, you have acumen. Even if you inherit an entire wholesale furniture dynasty from your grandfather, you could end up with nothing if you don’t have his business acumen.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/acumen
acute,ending in a sharp point,Use the adjective acute for when you want to describe something as sharp or extremely serious.,"The word acute is one word; it's not two words, nor does it have anything to do with something small, cuddly, and pretty! Acute really means ""sharp"" or ""severe"" or ""intense"" and modifies certain kinds of angles in geometry or describes a certain kind of illness of short duration. The English word apparently entered the language during the sixteenth century from the Latin root acutus, which means ""sharp"" or ""pointed.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/acute
adamant,"impervious to pleas, persuasion, requests, or reason","If you stubbornly refuse to change your mind about something, you are adamant about it.","This word's story begins in ancient Greece, where philosophers spoke about a legendary unbreakable stone or metal they called adamas (literally, ""invincible""). In English, people began to use the word to refer to something that cannot be altered, and then in the twentieth century — after adamant had been in English for about a thousand years — it came to be used as an adjective to mean ""unyielding as stone."" If you're adamant about something, no amount of persuasion is going to convince you otherwise.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/adamant
address,speak to,"When you are a student and you want to address your teacher, it's generally safer to call her Ms. and not address her by her first name, Esmeralda.","Address is a word that's long been associated with correspondence — the street number, city, state, and postal code that must be on the front of any envelope if it's going to arrive at its destination. In the digital age, an address has also come to mean the location where you might e-mail your friend pictures of your dog dressed up in a birthday hat. If you wanted to tell that friend about your dog's birthday party in person, you might address her directly. Address to describe a way of speaking is usually reserved for more formal occasions, such as when the President addresses the nation.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/address
adherent,someone who believes and helps to spread a doctrine,"Because an adherent is usually something or someone that sticks to something or someone else, it's logical that it can also mean a person who believes in and supports a certain philosophy or leader.","An adherent to a cause can be called a disciple, one who believes and tries to get others to believe. It can also refer to a material that sticks to other things. While the first meaning comes from the 15th century, the reference to a sticky substance didn't emerge until the 16th. In all cases, the word comes from the Latin root haerēre ""stick,"" connected to the prefix ad- ""to,"" making the word mean ""to stick to.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/adherent
admonish,warn strongly; put on guard,"To admonish is to scold. If you want to show someone you're not happy with his behavior, admonish him.","Coming to English through Old French from the Latin admonere ""to advise, remind,"" admonish is always used with an eye on improving someone's behavior. The exact meaning of this formal verb varies in intensity depending generally on who is being corrected. If a child or subordinate is being admonished, it means ""scold"" or ""rebuke"" whereas if someone admonishes a person with equal standing, warn or advise are closer synonyms.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/admonish
adroit,quick or skillful or adept in action or thought,Someone who is adroit is clever and skillful. An adroit leader will be able to persuade people to go with his ideas. An adroit sculptor can turn a lump of clay into an object of great beauty.,"If you've ever studied French you know that droit means ""right,"" both as in ""right of free speech"" and as in ""left and right,"" and à droit means both ""turn right"" and ""properly."" Once English people borrowed à droit, they changed the meaning slightly, from doing something ""properly"" to ""doing something well."" You may have heard the expression ""surprisingly adroit,"" as in, ""For a guy whose wife does all the cooking, he is surprisingly adroit in the kitchen.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/adroit
adulation,exaggerated flattery or praise,If you've ever been to a pop concert filled with screaming fans you've probably been exposed to adulation — praise so over-the-top it's almost embarrassing.,"The Latin word adulatio means ""flattery."" It's made up of the roots ad (""to"") and ulos (""tail""), and if you're thinking of a dog wagging its tail to and fro to get a treat from its owner, you're on the right track. As anyone who's seen a crazed fan drooling over a celebrity knows, adulation is one of the more doglike of human behaviors.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/adulation
adulterate,make impure by adding a foreign or inferior substance,"If you adulterate something, you mess it up. You may not want to adulterate the beauty of freshly fallen snow by shoveling it, but how else are you going to get to work?","The verb adulterate comes from the Latin word adulterare, which means “to falsify,” or “to corrupt.” Whenever something original, pure, fresh, or wholesome is marred, polluted, defaced, or otherwise made inferior, it has been adulterated. Your grandfather may, for instance, believe that bartenders adulterate the name “Martini” by applying it to combinations of vodka, chocolate or anything other than a mixture of five parts gin to one part dry vermouth, on the rocks, with a twist.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/adulterate
adverse,in an opposing direction,"Steer clear of anything adverse. If it's adverse, it's working against you — like adverse weather conditions or the adverse effects of eating too much sugar.","Coming from the Latin adversus meaning ""turned against,"" adverse is an adjective describing a factor that seems to work against or actively harm something. Think of the related word, adversary, which means enemy or opponent, so that if something is adverse, it acts as if it were the enemy. If you have an adverse reaction to an antibiotic, your doctor will need to prescribe a new medication.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/adverse
aesthetic,characterized by an appreciation of beauty or good taste,The adjective aesthetic comes in handy when the subject at hand is beauty or the arts. A velvet painting of dogs playing poker might have minimal aesthetic appeal.,"Aesthetic, from a Greek word meaning ""perception,"" comes to us from German philosophers who used it for a theory of the beautiful. From this technical sense, it soon came to refer to good taste and to artistry in general; if something has ""aesthetic value,"" it has value as a work of art (even if nobody will pay much for it). It does not, however, refer to the objects themselves; do not talk about an ""aesthetic painting.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/aesthetic
affable,diffusing warmth and friendliness,"Affable means friendly, pleasant, and easy to talk to. An affable host offers you something to drink and makes you feel at home.","The adjective affable entered English by way of the Latin word affābilis, which means ""kind, friendly."" If you’re stuck on an airplane next to someone affable, the trip won’t be so bad because that person will be easy to chat with but won’t talk your ear off. Synonyms of affable also refer to a pleasant and mild friendliness, such as genial, hospitable, and gracious. Affable people generally seem like they’re in a good mood and are happy to see you.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/affable
affectation,a deliberate pretense or exaggerated display,The guy at your local coffee shop who's never left the state but speaks as though he's lived in London all his life? His British accent is an affectation.,"Never confuse affectation with affection — which means “love” or “tenderness.” While affection might not always be genuine, affectation is never the real thing. In fact, affectation is all about faking it. Do you believe the politician cares about poor people, or do you think his concern is an affectation?",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/affectation
affinity,a natural attraction or feeling of kinship,"If you get along with someone very well, you have an affinity with them. Sometimes opposites attract, so you might feel a strange affinity to someone who is seemingly very different from you.","When you are attracted to someone or something a great deal, we say that you have an affinity, a natural connection. Likewise, scientists use affinity to describe organisms that are alike or resemble each other. Interestingly, the Middle English word, affinite, originally applied to people who were connected or related by marriage, rather than by biology.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/affinity
affluent,having an abundant supply of money or possessions of value,"You know you're driving through an affluent neighborhood when you see large houses, perfect landscaping, and expensive cars. Use affluent to describe wealthy people or areas.","In Middle English, affluent meant ""abundant, flowing,"" from Old French, from Latin affluēns, from affluere ""to abound in,"" from the prefix ad- ""to, at"" plus fluere ""to flow."" The meaning of ""abundant, flowing"" is still seen in phrases such as ""affluent prose."" But mostly, when you use the word affluent, the thing understood to be flowing is cash.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/affluent
agenda,"a list of matters to be taken up, as at a meeting","An agenda is a list of things to do. If you're going to attend a meeting with a long agenda, you'll want to take your coffee mug along.","The word agenda is the plural for of the Latin word agendum, which literally means ""something to be done."" The noun retains this meaning because an agenda is a plan — organized by time — of events or things to do. You might have a meeting, a lunch date, and a doctor's appointment on your agenda for the day. And when you run for office, you better have a political agenda — or a plan for what you want to get done if elected.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/agenda
aggregate,a sum total of many heterogeneous things taken together,"To aggregate is to collect many units into one. If you're writing a novel, you might create a character who is an aggregate of five or six real people.","Aggregate comes from the Latin verb aggregare, which means to add to. As a verb it means to collect into a mass or whole. You can also use it as an adjective, as in your aggregate sales for February, March and April. It can also be a noun. The mountain of foam in bubble bath is an aggregate of small bubbles. If you plan to work in economics or business, expect to see the word aggregate quite a lot.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/aggregate
agnostic,a person who claims the existence of God is unknowable,"If someone believes they cannot know whether or not God exists, label them an agnostic. A bad joke: Did you hear about the dyslexic agnostic insomniac? He stayed up all night wondering if there was a dog.","In 1869, English biologist T.H. Huxley coined this noun referring to someone whose religious beliefs lie somewhere in between those of a theist and an atheist — that is, a believer and a disbeliever in God. Huxley combined the Greek prefix a-, meaning ""not,"" with gnostos, ""known."" It can be used as a noun or adjective, and it can also refer to uncertainty about questions other than the existence of God: ""Some philosophers remain agnostic as to whether people have free will.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/agnostic
agrarian,relating to rural matters,"Use the word agrarian to describe something related to fields, farming, or rural matters. The school calendar is still based on the old agrarian calendar, when children needed to be off during the summer to help with planting and harvesting.","The adjective agrarian comes from the Latin root word ager, meaning a field, but the word's meaning has expanded to include anything rural or farm-related. ""The senator, who represented mostly agrarian communities, spent most of her time working on issues of interest to farmers. She lobbied to stabilize the price of corn and milk, fought for subsidies for working farms, and presented ribbons to the prized pig at the county fair.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/agrarian
alacrity,liveliness and eagerness,"Someone with alacrity shows cheerful willingness and eager behavior, like a kid whose mother has told him he can buy anything in a candy store.","While the noun alacrity normally refers to someone's peppy behavior, it can also describe a certain mood or tempo of a musical composition, indicating how the music should be played. Alacrity comes from the Latin alacritas, and the Italian musical term allegro is a near relation.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/alacrity
allege,report or maintain,"If you accuse someone of committing a crime but the proof of the wrongdoing isn't yet found, use the verb allege. You might allege that your sister broke a vase, just because no one else was home when you heard the crash.","If you ever watch news programs, you often hear the verb allege. A reporter might say that detectives allege that a certain person, who is now being held without bail, set a fire. This can be confusing: If the person is in jail, then he or she must have set that fire, right? In reality, the person is a suspect, awaiting trial. In our country, people are assumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. That's why we used allege until we know for sure.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/allege
alleviate,"provide physical relief, as from pain","Do all these words make your head ache? If so, take an aspirin to alleviate, or relieve, your pain.","The verb, alleviate, stems from the Latin root, levis ""light"" and is related to modern English words such as elevator and levitate — both words implying a lightening of one's load. Alleviate also has this sense of lightening a burden such as physical pain or emotional duress. You can take medicine to alleviate symptoms or do exercise to alleviate stress. Or if you want a bigger challenge: try alleviating traffic congestion or world hunger.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/alleviate
allocate,distribute according to a plan or set apart for a purpose,"To allocate is to set aside a certain amount of money for an expense. You usually hear about the government allocating funds for education or the military, but you may personally allocate some of your allowance to buying comic books.","Aside from money, a common thing to allocate is time: ""The old woman in the shoe had so many children she could only allocate 2.7 minutes per day to talk to each one individually."" Resources are also often allocated. Teachers, for example, are continuously allocating their year's supply of resources so they don't run out of glue sticks and paper before the end of the school year.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/allocate
alloy,a mixture containing two or more metallic elements,"You may have heard of aluminum alloy on a car. What that means is that there is another metal mixed in with the aluminum, to save money and/or to strengthen the wheels. The wheels are an alloy (a mix), rather than pure.","In addition to indicating a dilution of one metal with another, alloy can refer to the dilution of a feeling or a quality. Knowing that you look awesome in your Halloween costume would be an alloy to the embarrassment of showing up to a party where you are the only one in a costume.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/alloy
allusion,passing reference or indirect mention,"That little nod to a Dylan Thomas poem that you sneaked into your PowerPoint presentation? That was an allusion, a quick reference to something that your audience will have to already know in order to ""get.""","An allusion often references a famous work of art or literature, or to something from your own life. For example, you might say, ""I obviously am no expert at love"" — an allusion to your failed relationships. The main thing to remember is that an allusion is a brief hint or a quick mention. It’s meant to bring to mind a particular subject, but it always avoids getting into it in great depth.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/allusion
aloof,remote in manner,"Someone who's aloof isn't warm and friendly, instead being distant and reserved. That emotionally cold and detached fellow who keeps to himself, drinking espresso and reading French philosophy, would best be described as aloof.","In Middle English, aloof was originally a nautical term; the loof (now spelled luff) is the windward side of a ship. Smart sailors wanting to avoid a hazard on the leeward side would give the order, ""A loof!"" From this command we get the idea of steering clear of something (or someone). In modern usage the word has taken on a negative connotation: an aloof person is often considered cold or snobby.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/aloof
altruism,the quality of unselfish concern for the welfare of others,"If you see a stranger getting beaten up on the playground and you rush in to rescue them, you have done something unselfish to help another person, otherwise known as an act of altruism.","Use the noun altruism to refer to feelings or actions that show an unselfish concern for other people. In science, altruism refers to animal behavior that could be harmful to the animal itself but that contributes to the survival of the animal group. It's related to the adjective altruistic. Someone known for their altruism is an altruist.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/altruism
ambience,the atmosphere of an environment,"Ambience is another word for atmosphere in the sense of the mood a place or setting has. If an expensive restaurant has soft lighting and peaceful music, it has a pleasant, soothing ambience.","Ambience is one of those words that we've out and out stolen from French. In French, the word meaning the same thing is, you guessed it, ambience. This is a word you're going to want to know if you have any interest in restaurant reviews — they always want to talk about the ambience. As a funny quirk, the word has a positive feel to it; it can be used to mean nice atmosphere without even using the word, nice, as in, ""Hey, this place really has ambience.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ambience
ambiguous,having more than one possible meaning,"Look to the adjective ambiguous when you need to describe something that's open to more than one interpretation, like the headline ""Squad helps dog bite victim.""","Newspaper headlines can be unintentionally funny when they're ambiguous. In ""Squad helps dog bite victim,"" is the squad helping a victim of a dog bite or helping a dog bite a victim? The ambi- prefix means ""both ways,"" while the guous part is from the Latin verb agere, ""to lead or drive."" Thus an ambiguous sentence or situation drives us in two different directions at once. The accent is on the second syllable, ""big,"" which you can remember since something that's ambiguous can lead to big misunderstandings.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ambiguous
ambivalent,uncertain or unable to decide about what course to follow,"If you can't decide how you feel about something, declare yourself ambivalent about it.","Ambivalent means ""having mixed feelings about something."" A Swiss psychologist named Eugen Bleuler coined the German word Ambivalenz in the early twentieth century, and it was soon imported into English. Bleuler combined the Latin prefix ambi-, meaning ""both,"" with valentia, ""strength."" So etymologically speaking, if you're ambivalent you're being pulled by two equally strong things — but in practice, ambivalence often arises from caring very little either way. You might feel ambivalent about your lunch options if you have to choose between a murky stew and flavorless tofu.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ambivalent
ameliorate,make better,To ameliorate is to step in and make a bad situation better. You could try introducing a second lollipop to ameliorate a battle between two toddlers over a single lollipop.,"The verb ameliorate comes from the Latin word meliorare, meaning “improve.” Food drives can ameliorate hunger. An air conditioner can ameliorate the discomfort of a stiflingly hot summer day. A sympathy card can ameliorate grief. Family therapy can ameliorate severe sibling rivalry. Anything that can lift a burden or make something better can ameliorate.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ameliorate
amenable,disposed or willing to comply,"If your friends want to try sky diving and you're amenable to the idea, sounds like you're going to be jumping out of a plane. If a person or thing is amenable to something, they are ready, willing, or responsive.","Note that amenable is often followed by the preposition to, which makes amenable mean ""able to be controlled or affected by something,"" as in: ""They are usually amenable to our wishes"" or ""Her heart condition is not amenable to treatment."" An amenable personality is open to influence or control and is willing to agree or yield.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/amenable
amenity,pleasantness resulting from agreeable conditions,"Like built-in GPS, seat warmers and four-wheel drive, an amenity is a feature that contributes to comfort or value. Or in another sense, it's the overall pleasantness that results from all those cool features.","Declared the American novelist Edith Wharton, “I despair of the Republic! Such dreariness, such whining sallow women, such utter absence of the amenities, such crass food, crass manners, crass landscape! What a horror it is for a whole nation to be developing without the sense of beauty, and eating bananas for breakfast.” As you can see, people throughout time have gotten cranky when they’ve felt their amenities to be lacking.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/amenity
amiable,diffusing warmth and friendliness,"A friendly, pleasant person could be described as amiable. Airline flight attendants tend to be amiable. The people monitoring the school's cafeteria? Maybe not.","An amiable person is good-natured and easy to get along with. Add one letter and you get amicable, a word with a common ancestor (Latin amicabilis) and a similar meaning. But while amiable refers to friendly people, amicable refers to friendly relations between them; two amiable people who no longer want to be married to one another might have an amicable divorce.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/amiable
amnesty,a warrant granting release from punishment for an offense,"Amnesty can mean a pardon for a wrongdoing, or it can also signal a government's willingness to overlook something.","Amnesty sounds a little like ""amnesia,"" and that's because in its more specific sense amnesty means ""forgetting."" The government will essentially forget about whatever crime was committed, or whatever horrible things were said. As part of a truce, amnesty can be granted to opposition forces in civil disputes. Amnesty to illegal aliens means the government will deliberately overlook their illegal entry to the country. There can also be a period of amnesty when people can turn in something that they would otherwise get in trouble for. ""The city offered a period of amnesty for everyone to turn in illegal guns.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/amnesty
amoralism,the doctrine that moral distinctions are invalid,,,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/amoralism
amorous,inclined toward or displaying love,"If you are shot with a mythological arrow by Cupid, the Greek god of love, you may find yourself making amorous advances on the next person you meet. Amorous means having strong feelings of love, especially sexual love.","Amorous words or glances show love or sexual desire. This adjective is a Middle English word, borrowed from Middle French, from Medieval Latin amorosus, from Latin amor ""love."" A more literary and less common synonym is amatory.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/amorous
amorphous,having no definite form or distinct shape,"Amorphous means without a clearly defined form, like the moon's amorphous reflection in a lake. Figuratively, something amorphous lacks focus, be it a work of art, a political movement, or even someone's life plans.","The Greek roots of this word are clear: morphē means ""form,"" and a- means ""lacking or without."" When creative works or ideas are described as amorphous, it means they suffer from a lack of organization. An amorphous object lacks a well-defined outline or structure, like amorphous jellyfish drifting on the surface of the ocean. And scientifically, this adjective simply describes something without a crystalline form, like an amorphous metal or amorphous ice.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/amorphous
anachronism,locating something at a time when it couldn't have existed,"An anachronism is something that doesn't fit its time period, like if you say you'll ""dial"" your smartphone.","Anachronism comes from the Greek roots ana- which means ""against"" and chron- which means ""time."" Together they represent a situation in which something happens that should not because it belongs to another time period. You see anachronisms all the time in the movies — they occur when you see a jet fly over a Civil War battle! Or knights jousting over a maiden during the time of Shakespeare!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/anachronism
analogy,drawing a comparison in order to show a similarity,"When you draw an analogy between two things, you compare them for the purpose of explanation. The movie character Forrest Gump made a silly analogy famous: ""Life is like a box of chocolates.""","Some standardized tests still have ""analogy questions,"" which are given in this format: A : B :: C : ___ (read ""A is to B as C is to what?""). This is a more formalized version of something we do every day: compare one thing to another. It's a useful way of speaking — if a scientist explains that the earth's forests function as its lungs, we understand the analogy to mean that both trees and lungs take in important elements from the air. But when Forrest Gump says life is like a box of chocolates because you never know what you're going to get, that's a pretty brainless analogy.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/analogy
anarchy,a state of lawlessness and disorder,Use the noun anarchy to describe a complete lack of government — or the chaotic state of affairs created by such an absence. A substitute teacher might worry that an unruly classroom will descend into anarchy.,"From the Greek for ""without a ruler"" we get this word for the political philosophy that the best government is no government at all — a movement that enjoyed surprising success worldwide in the early and middle parts of the twentieth century. Today, the word is more commonly used to describe not a political ideal but a state of total disorder, chaos and even violence: ""A type of bloody anarchy is beginning to reign."" A good synonym would be ""lawlessness.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/anarchy
anecdote,short account of an incident,"A short, amusing true story is an anecdote. You might come back from a crazy spring break with a lot of anecdotes to tell.","The roots of anecdote lie in the Greek word anekdota, meaning ""unpublished."" The word's original sense in English was ""secret or private stories"" — tales not fit for print, so to speak. It can still have connotations of unreliability, as in the phrase ""anecdotal information."" But the most common sense today is that of ""a funny story about something that happened.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/anecdote
anguish,extreme distress of body or mind,The noun anguish refers to severe physical or emotional pain or distress. A trip to the dentist might cause a cavity-prone person a lot of anguish.,"We get this word from a Latin word, angustus, which literally meant ""narrow"" but developed the figurative sense of ""distressed"" — think of being choked off or forced into a small space. In modern times anguish has been in the English with the parallel and related meanings of ""physical torment"" and ""emotional suffering."" Both kinds might be experienced at the hands of a dentist who likes to make his patients squirm in agony.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/anguish
animosity,a feeling of ill will arousing active hostility,"Animosity is hatred. If your (supposed) best buddy embarrasses you in front of a big crowd, your friendship could turn into animosity.","Animosity comes from the Latin word animus, meaning ""spirit"" or ""mind."" That's also the root of the word animated — literally, ""full of spirit."" So how did animosity get so negative? Over the centuries, the original meaning of ""high spirits"" soured into ""hatred."" Today we most often speak of animosity toward, between, among, or against people. Keeping your animosity in check might make steam come out your ears.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/animosity
anomaly,deviation from the normal or common order or form or rule,"An anomaly is an abnormality, a blip on the screen of life that doesn’t fit with the rest of the pattern. If you are a breeder of black dogs and one puppy comes out pink, that puppy is an anomaly.","The noun anomaly comes from the Greek word anomolia, meaning ""uneven” or “irregular.” When something is unusual compared to similar things around it, it’s the anomaly. If you are an Olympian who comes from a family of bookish types who all find it strenuous to walk the dog, you are an anomaly.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/anomaly
antecedent,a preceding occurrence or cause or event,"An antecedent is a thing that comes before something else. You might think rap music has no historical antecedent, but earlier forms of African-American spoken verse go back for centuries.","In logic, mathematics, and grammar, the word antecedent (from Latin ante-, ""before"" + cedere, ""to yield"") has the meaning ""the first part of a statement."" More generally, it means ""something that came before, and perhaps caused, something else."" The word is also an adjective: a lawyer or judge might talk about the ""antecedent events"" leading up to someone committing a crime.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/antecedent
antipathy,a feeling of intense dislike,"An antipathy is a deep-seated dislike of something or someone. Usually it's a condition that is long-term, innate, and pretty unlikely to change — like your antipathy for the Red Sox.","If you look at the Greek roots of this word — anti- (""against"") and pathos (""feeling"") — you can see that antipathy is a feeling against someone or something. In general, antipathies are feelings that are kept at least somewhat under wraps and are not out in the open.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/antipathy
antithesis,exact opposite,"An antithesis is the complete opposite of something. Though the counterculture was strong in America in 1968, voters elected Richard Nixon, the antithesis of a hippie.","The noun antithesis comes from a Greek root meaning ""opposition"" and ""set against."" It's often used today when describing two ideas or terms that are placed in strong contrast to each other. We might come across antithesis in school if we learn about the ""Hegelian dialectic."" There, the thesis, or main idea put forward in an argument, is countered with its opposite idea — the antithesis — and the two are finally reconciled in a third proposition, the synthesis. An antithesis wouldn't exist without a thesis because it works as a comparison.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/antithesis
apartheid,a social policy of racial segregation,"Apartheid was a racist political policy in South Africa demanding segregation of the nation's white and non-white populations. During South African apartheid, more than three million black citizens were forced to move from their homes to segregated neighborhoods.","The law of apartheid came into being with the South African election in 1948. So it makes sense that the word's history goes back to that date, from the Afrikaans word for ""separateness."" It comes from the Dutch, with the ""heid"" part meaning ""hood,"" for ""apart-hood."" The word is pronounced ""apart-hate,"" which is also an apt description for a policy that brutally oppressed an entire people based solely on their skin color. The system was ended in 1993.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apartheid
apathy,an absence of emotion or enthusiasm,Use the noun apathy when someone isn't interested in the important things that are happening. You might feel apathy for the political process after watching candidates bicker tediously with one another.,"Although apathy is a lazy-sounding word indicating a lack of interest, action, or emotion, it has traveled through many languages to arrive in English. From the Greek apatheia, ""freedom from suffering"" or ""impassibility,"" apathy has existed in English since the 17th century. Not just one person, but a whole segment of the population can be accused of inaction or emotional detachment: the expressions voter apathy, student apathy, and consumer apathy show just how unenthusiastic groups of people can be.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apathy
aphorism,a short pithy instructive saying,"Use the noun aphorism when you have something compact and astute to say, such as ""People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.""","An aphorism is a statement or saying that is both efficiently presented and either witty or wise. While there are loads of trite and silly statements, a good aphorism is supposed to stand the test of time and remain true and elegant — a very difficult task! Friedrich Schlegel even wrote an aphorism about aphorisms: ""An aphorism ought to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world like a little work of art and complete in itself like a hedgehog.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/aphorism
apocalypse,a cosmic cataclysm in which God destroys the powers of evil,"Apocalypse is a word that means ""the end of the world"" — or something so destructive it seems like the world has ended in a place, like a major earthquake.","The apocalypse is the total destruction of the world, as prophesied in the biblical book of Revelation. Apocalypse can be used to describe utter destruction caused by war or natural disaster. The nuclear bomb attack on Hiroshima during World War II can be called an apocalypse because the devastation was so severe and so many lives were lost.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apocalypse
apocryphal,being of questionable authenticity,"Urban legends — stories about phantom hitchhikers, deep-fried rats, and spider eggs in bubblegum — are classic examples of apocryphal tales. They're told as if they're true, but no one can ever verify their origins or authenticity.","Today, any dubious or unverifiable story may be dismissed as apocryphal. Originally, however, apocryphal was reserved for religious writings that were not included in the Torah or the New Testament of the Bible because the divinity of the texts was not certain. These texts are known as the Apocrypha and are included in the Septuagint (a Greek version of the Hebrew Bible) and the Vulgate (a Latin Bible edited in the 4th century).",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apocryphal
apotheosis,model of excellence or perfection of a kind,"If your teacher says the term paper you handed in last week is a work of genius that sets a new gold standard for the school, he's telling you your work is the apotheosis of term papers. The epitome. Perfection.","Hidden in the middle of apotheosis you'll find the Greek theos, meaning god. (Theology, the study of religion, has the same root.) Combine theos with apo ""from"" and you get a person, place, or thing that is so out-of-this-world amazing that it seems as if it's ""from God."" It's divine. You could make the assertion that Leonardo da Vinci was the apotheosis of genius and that the Mona Lisa is the apotheosis of all his paintings.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apotheosis
appease,make peace with,"Appease means to make or preserve peace with a nation, group, or person by giving in to their demands, or to relieve a problem, as in ""the cold drink appeased his thirst.""","Appease often implies abandoning your moral principles to satisfy the demands of someone who is greedy for power: think of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's attempt to appease the Nazis at Munich. The verb appease comes from the Old French apaisier, ""to pacify, make peace, or be reconciled,"" from the phrase ""a paisier,"" which combines a-, or ""to,"" and pais, ""peace,"" from the Latin pax.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/appease
appreciate,increase the value of,"If you appreciate something, you recognize its value. We can all appreciate how refreshing cold lemonade is on a sweltering summer day.","The oldest meaning of appreciate is ""to know the worth of something"": ""The parolee appreciated his newfound freedom."" A related sense is ""to be grateful for something,"" but this usage can sound wordy. Instead of ""I would appreciate your sending me more information,"" consider: ""Please send me more information."" The word can also be used (without a direct object) to mean ""to rise in worth"": ""The vintage Corvette would appreciate in value over the years.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/appreciate
apprehensive,in fear or dread of possible evil or harm,"If you're apprehensive, you're anxious or fearful. If you live near a busy intersection with no stop signs, you might be a bit apprehensive about crossing the street.","Apprehensive is from a Latin word meaning ""to seize,"" and it originally meant ""quick to seize impressions or ideas, perceptive, intelligent."" Now it means ""anticipating something bad, fearful of what may happen."" Synonyms are afraid, which suggest a more immediate fear, and fearful, which suggests a more general temperament (""a fearful child""). You can be apprehensive about a situation while being an optimistic and courageous person in general.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apprehensive
approbation,official acceptance or agreement,Approbation is a formal word for approval or praise. Approbation is like getting the nod in a big way. Politicians rely on the public’s approbation to get elected.,"How is it possible that approbation means approval when probation is a form of being in trouble? Probation is a testing period, to see if you can be good. Approbation means it's all good. Or you can remember this rhyme: ""Filled with approbation, the audience gave a standing ovation.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/approbation
appropriate,take possession of by force,"Something appropriate is correct and fits the situation. A sweater-vest with reindeer on it is appropriate holiday apparel, even if it's totally embarrassing.","The adjective appropriate is used when something is suitable or fitting. It comes from the Latin appropriare, which means ""to make something fit, to make something one's own."" Going back even further, appropriate is related to the Latin word proprius, ""to belong to a person, thing, or group."" Another appropriate way to use this word is as a verb, meaning to steal or seize something, the way you'd appropriate your sister's sandwich if she left it sitting near you.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/appropriate
aptitude,inherent ability,"An aptitude is something you're good at. A rock star might have an aptitude for energizing an audience, or for trashing his hotel room.","When you have a talent or do something well, people say that you have an aptitude for it. But you don't have to be born with an aptitude; you can also acquire your abilities. You are probably already well acquainted with this word, since the zillions of standardized tests you have taken in school are usually called aptitude tests.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/aptitude
arbiter,someone chosen to judge and decide a disputed issue,"An arbiter is someone selected to judge and settle a dispute. When Doc and Grumpy disagreed over whose turn it was to stay late at the mine, they chose Snow White as an arbiter.","Arbiter, from the Latin, means ""one who goes somewhere as witness or judge.” The arbiter of a baseball game is called an umpire. In football and basketball, the arbiter is a referee. Arbitration is a type of conflict resolution in which a neutral person — the arbiter — hears the details of a dispute and makes a legally-binding decision about its resolution.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/arbiter
arbitrary,based on or subject to individual discretion or preference,Something that's arbitrary seems like it's chosen at random instead of following a consistent rule. Team members would dislike their coach using a totally arbitrary method to pick starting players.,"Even though arbitrary comes from a word meaning ""judge"" (arbiter), that doesn't mean judges are always fair. Calling a decision-maker arbitrary is usually a negative thing, suggesting the person is making rules based on whim rather than justice. A coach who selects starting players arbitrarily isn't strictly applying a rule; he could just be picking names out of a hat.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/arbitrary
arcane,requiring secret or mysterious knowledge,"Something arcane is understood or known by only a few people. Almost everyone knows the basics of baseball, but only an elite few possess the arcane knowledge of its history that marks the true fan.","A near synonym is esoteric, as in ""relating to remote information or knowledge."" Experts in academic fields often show off the depth of their knowledge by mentioning some arcane and esoteric fact as if it was common for everyone to know. The origin of arcane is Latin arcānus, ""secret, closed,"" from arca, ""a chest, box."" Arcana (singular arcanum) are pieces of mysterious knowledge or information.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/arcane
archaic,so extremely old as seeming to belong to an earlier period,"If you use the adjective archaic you are referring to something outmoded, belonging to an earlier period. Rotary phones and cassette players already seem so archaic!","The adjective archaic means something that belongs to an earlier or antiquated time. It can also mean something that is outdated but can still be found in the present and therefore could seem out of place. The word comes from archaic (i.e., ancient) Greek, archaikos, and literally means ""from Classical Greek culture,"" though its meaning has broadened as it's been used in English.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/archaic
archetype,something that serves as a model,"An archetype is a perfect example or model of something. If you have long blonde hair, a sparkly ball gown, and a fairy godmother hovering over your head, you're the archetype of a fairytale princess.","In the psychology of Carl Jung, an archetype is an inherited pattern of thought derived from the past experience of the whole race and present in our unconscious minds––Cinderella might be an archetype for girls in our culture; the boogey man is another. This noun is from Latin archetypum, from Greek archetypon, from archetypos ""of the first mold,"" from archein ""to begin"" plus typos ""type.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/archetype
ardent,characterized by intense emotion,"If you are ardent, you are passionate about something. A pop star's ardent admirers might go so crazy at his concert that they faint from excitement.","Ardent is most often used to modify words like supporter, fan, advocate, admirer, and defender — but also opponent. Although you can either ardently support or oppose something, support is by far the more common use. The word literally means ""burning"" or ""glowing"" — it's from Latin ardere, ""to burn."" In poetic use, the word is sometimes used to mean ""glowing,"" as Alexander Pope did in his 1718 translation of Homer's Iliad: ""From rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ardent
arduous,characterized by effort to the point of exhaustion,Use the adjective arduous to describe an activity that takes a lot of effort. Writing all those college essays and filling out the applications is an arduous process!,"Arduous was first used in English to mean ""steep"" or ""difficult to climb."" If you're an outdoorsman, hiking up a mountain is a lot of fun, but if you're a couch potato, it's an arduous trek. Today, the word can be used figuratively for something that is difficult or takes a lot of work. If you spend an arduous week studying for your final exams, you'll do well because you've worked really hard!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/arduous
aristocratic,belonging to or characteristic of the nobility,The word aristocratic describes a person at the highest level of society — such as a prince or a duchess — or those people or things that are so distinguished that they seem to belong to that group.,"First used around the 1560s, the adjective aristocratic has origins in the Greek word aristokratia, meaning ""government, rule of the best."" An aristocratic person usually gains this social status through birthright rather than demonstrated merit. Aristocratic can describe someone or something belonging to this group, like an aristocratic estate or an aristocratic leader, but it can also describe something grand and elegant. You might have an aristocratic expression on your face as you attend a formal party.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/aristocratic
artful,marked by skill or cunning in achieving a desired end,"To be artful is to do something skillfully, especially in a cunning way. A con man must be artful.","To be an artist requires skill and talent: it's not easy to make art. Similarly, doing something in an artful way takes skill. A chess player is artful in escaping an opponent's attack. A politician is artful in appealing to different groups of people. This word also indicates that the skill shown is a little cunning or sneaky. In movies, villains are often artful, as they tell lies or hatch schemes. Often, artful is the opposite of straightforward.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/artful
artifice,the use of deception or trickery,"If a politician pretends to be angry as a way of rousing the anger of the voters and getting more votes, he's guilty of artifice — a subtle and crafty trick.","Before taking on its current meaning, artifice meant a skilled piece of workmanship. A beautiful diamond bracelet might have been considered a piece of artifice, for example; now it would only be called artifice if the diamonds were fake.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/artifice
ascendancy,the state when one person or group has power over another,"When you assume ascendancy over someone else, you become more powerful than they are. Ascendancy is the state of being in a higher position.","If you look at ascendancy, you see the word, ascend, which means to go up. Ascendancy is not so much about going up, but about being up. Another word for it is dominance, especially in the context of foreign or domestic relations. In school, if you question a teacher's ascendancy, you might be told to go to the principal's office. In this case, you're challenging the teacher's authority.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ascendancy
ascetic,someone who practices self denial as a spiritual discipline,"Want to live an ascetic lifestyle? Then you better ditch the flat panel TV and fuzzy slippers. To be ascetic, you learn to live without; it's all about self-denial.","Ascetic is derived from the Greek asketes, meaning “monk,” or “hermit.” Later that became asketikos, meaning “rigorously self-disciplined,” which gives us the Modern English ascetic. Ascetic can be a noun: a person with incredible self-discipline and the ability to deprive herself, or an adjective that describes such a people or their lifestyle.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ascetic
assiduous,marked by care and persistent effort,"If you call someone assiduous, it's a compliment. It means they're careful, methodical and very persistent. Good detectives are classically assiduous types.","Assiduous comes from two Latin words: assiduus, meaning ""busy incessant, continual or constant,"" and assidere, meaning ""to sit down to"" something. (Funnily enough, we also get the word sedentary, meaning someone who doesn't move around much, a lazy couch potato, from this same last word.) Although we tend to think of sedentary types as being the very opposite of assiduous ones, many assiduous activities (like writing, thinking, or detective work) are best done sitting in a chair.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/assiduous
assimilate,take up mentally,"If you are trying to fit in, you are trying to assimilate.","Imported from Latin, assimilate has the word similar within it and in fact, means ""to become like something else."" If someone moves to another country, he or she will need to assimilate by adapting to and taking in the language, culture and customs of the new place. You can also turn the phrase around to say that a country assimilates immigrants, which means that a place accepts immigrants and allows them to adapt easily. In scientific use, the body assimilates nutrients as a part of digestion.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/assimilate
assuage,"provide physical relief, as from pain","If you assuage an unpleasant feeling, you make it go away. Assuaging your hunger by eating a bag of marshmallows may cause you other unpleasant feelings.","The most common things that we assuage are fears, concerns, guilt, grief, anxiety, and anger. That makes a lot of sense — these are all things we seek relief from. The word comes from Old French assouagier, from the Latin root suavis, ""sweet"" — think of adding a bit of honey to something unpleasant. A word with a similar meaning is mollify.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/assuage
astute,marked by practical hardheaded intelligence,Someone who is astute is clever and has good judgment. The kid running around with a bucket stuck on his head? Not so astute.,Astute (from Latin) is a formal and flattering adjective for someone with a good head on their shoulders. It differs from its synonym shrewd in placing less emphasis on hardheadedness than on sensitivity: we talk about a shrewd bargainer but an astute interpretation. Other synonyms are perceptive (emphasizing insight) and discerning (emphasizing an ability to distinguish).,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/astute
atheist,someone who denies the existence of god,"An atheist believes there is no such thing as god, or any other deity.","The root -theist means ""belief in a god."" The prefixes mono-, poly-, and a-, mean ""one,"" ""many,"" and ""no,"" respectively. So a monotheist is someone who believes in a single god, a polytheist is someone who believes in many gods, and an atheist is someone who believes there is no god at all.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/atheist
attrition,a wearing down to weaken or destroy,"Attrition is a gradual process of wearing down, weakening, or destroying something.","When a company wants to reduce its payroll without firing anyone, it will sometimes do so through attrition; that is, by waiting for people to retire or quit without hiring anyone new to replace them. In a more general sense, the word means break down, wear out, or reduce in numbers. A triple overtime basketball game, with many players fouling out, is a war of attrition. When you see the word attrition, think ""Gradually chipping away.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/attrition
audacity,aggressive or outright boldness,If you have audacity then you're one daring — and perhaps reckless — character. Running a red light with three previous tickets under your belt certainly shows audacity. And stupidity.,"The noun audacity developed from the Latin word audacitas, which means “boldness."" So someone who shows audacity makes bold moves — and isn't afraid of the consequences. Audacity can be admired or frowned upon, depending how far it's taken and how it rears its head. But as former British Prime Minister and novelist Benjamin Disraeli once said, “Success is the child of audacity.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/audacity
augment,enlarge or increase,"Do you need to make something bigger, better, or stronger? Then you need to augment it. To augment is to increase the amount or strength of something.","Maybe your bike isn't getting around very well on hills: the bike needs to be augmented with a better set of tires. People augment their computers and phones all the time, adding new gadgets and apps. They augment the storage space in their cars by buying roof racks. If the President decides to augment taxes, taxes are going up. When you see the word augment, think ""More!""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/augment
auspicious,indicating favorable circumstances and good luck,"Use the adjective auspicious for a favorable situation or set of conditions. If you start a marathon by falling flat on your face, that's not an auspicious start.","If something seems likely to bring success — either because it creates favorable conditions or you just consider it a lucky sign — label it auspicious. The word is related to auspice, ""a divine omen,"" an old word with a colorful history. In Latin, an auspex was a person who observed the flight of birds to predict things about the future. Luckily, you no longer have to be a bird-watching fortune-teller to guess whether something is auspicious or not.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/auspicious
austere,of a stern or strict bearing or demeanor,The adjective austere is used to describe something or someone stern or without any decoration. You wouldn't want someone to describe you or your home as austere.,"Austere is not usually a positive word because it means that a person or a thing isn't pleasurable. For example, if you go on an austere diet, it's likely you wouldn't ever get to have candy. The adjective comes into English by way of French, Latin, and Greek, meaning ""harsh"" and ""dry."" It's pronounced as ""ah-STEER,"" with an emphasis on the second syllable.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/austere
autocratic,characteristic of an absolute ruler or absolute rule,"Autocratic describes a way of ruling, but not in a nice way. An autocratic leader is one who rules with an iron fist; in other words — someone with the behavior of a dictator.","Autocratic rulers don't tend to be popular. They use fear and control to gain total power over their people. Often, their country is left destitute as a result of their actions. The word autocratic is often used to describe the head of a country, but really, anyone who is a despotic leader can qualify — including the boss who threatens to fire you if you refuse to polish his shoes and work every holiday.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/autocratic

avow,declare or affirm solemnly and formally as true,"When you avow something, you say it openly for the whole world to hear. If you're a witness in a trial, you'll be asked to take an oath in which you'll avow that you'll tell the truth.","A simple way to remember the meaning of avow is that it sounds and looks a whole lot like ""a vow,"" to which it's closely related. At the end of almost every wedding, the couple takes their vows, in which they avow their commitment to each other. To take a vow is to avow the things that you say in that vow.

That's no way to avow something.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/avow

The corresponding adjective is charismatic, and it applies more to personality than appearance: a handsome and charismatic actor. Charisma was borrowed from a Greek word meaning ""favor, gift,"" from charizesthai ""to favor,"" from charis ""grace.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/charisma
charlatan,a flamboyant deceiver,"A charlatan is a quack, a person who is trying to deceive you with false claims. Beware of charlatans who try to sell you access to the fountain of youth or to a Ponzi scheme disguised as an exclusive investment fund.","A charlatan is one who pretends to possess knowledge he or she lacks. From the 16th century Italian ciarlatano ""a quack,"" the usage of charlatan has not shifted much. Other words for charlatan are impostor, cheat, or pretender. Charlatans are marked by the elaborate schemes they cook up. Russian playwright Anton Chekhov said, ""No psychologist should pretend to understand what he does not understand...Only fools and charlatans know everything and understand nothing.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/charlatan
chasm,a deep opening in the earth's surface,"A chasm is a deep divide, either literal or figurative, such as a giant chasm in an ice cap or the growing chasm between two friends who haven't spoken in a long time.","The first syllable in chasm sounds like cat without the t sound: ""CA-zum."" It comes from the Greek word khasma, meaning ""yawning hollow, gulf"" and was originally used to describe a split in a land formation, such as a deep crack caused by an earthquake. The word still retains that sense, but today can also mean ""a profound division between people or beliefs,"" such as a chasm between Republicans and Democrats.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chasm
chastise,censure severely,"Chastise is a fancy word for telling someone that something they did was really bad. If you pick your nose, your mom will probably yell at you. If you pick your nose in front of the Queen of England, your mom will chastise you.","Back in the Middle Ages, chastise used to also come with a beating — that sense of the word has passed, and in fact, people tend to use chastise when they are trying to accuse someone else of overreacting. ""You're chastising me for forgetting to feed the cat, but it's not like the cat died!""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chastise
chicanery,the use of tricks to deceive someone,Have you ever gotten the sense that politicians or corporate leaders will say anything to turn public opinion their way? This tricky kind of deceit and manipulation is called chicanery.,"Besides chicanery, another funny-sounding word for trickery is shenanigans. Whereas the former is always used in the singular and involves deceptive language, the latter is usually used in the plural and refers to the actions of a person. Your crazy neighbor is up to his old shenanigans if he has begun doing weird stuff again, but if a politician's chicanery is exposed, he will lose public trust and not be returned to office in the next election cycle.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chicanery
chimera,a grotesque product of the imagination,"A chimera is something you’ve imagined that’s bits and pieces of other things mashed together into a new horrible fantasy, something impossible in real life that only exists in your mind.","In Greek mythology, a chimera is a monster that has a lion’s head, a goat’s body, and a serpent’s tail. And it breathes fire. No creature like that has ever existed, but the idea seemed real and terrifying to Greeks, and that’s another meaning: an idea that feels real but is impossible, like the idea of a world without evil. Pronouncing the word is very possible though; just try it one of two ways: either kye-MEER-uh or kih-MEER-uh. Both work.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chimera
choleric,characterized by anger,"Are you easy to tick off? Known to have a short fuse? Then, you could be described as choleric. Don't worry; it's not a disease related to cholera. Choleric just means you're testy and irritable.","Before the advent of modern medicine, most folks believed that health and disease were the result of the balance of ""humors"" in the body. If you were quick to anger, you were thought to have too much choler in your system. You were called choleric. W. C. Fields, Richard Nixon, and Ebenezer Scrooge are just a few people famous for being choleric, easy to tick off.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/choleric
chronic,long-lasting or characterized by long suffering,"If you smoke a cigarette once, you've simply made a bad choice. But if you're a chronic smoker, you've been smoking for a long time and will have a hard time stopping.","The word chronic is used to describe things that occur over a long period of time and, in fact, comes from the Greek word for time, khronos. If you have chronic asthma, it is a recurring health issue for you. No one likes a chronic liar! A problem that cannot be solved can also be called chronic - think of the chronic food shortages in certain parts of the world.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chronic
chronicle,a record or narrative description of past events,"To chronicle an event is to record it as it happens, and a chronicle is a record of those events. If your grandmother took the time to chronicle the details of her 1910 journey to Japan, you can read her chronicle today.","To chronicle something is to describe past or current events. Chronicle is related to chronological and comes from the Greek ta khronika, which means “annals of time.” Events are usually chronicled in the order in which they occurred. The noun chronicle is a record of things that happened — told in chronological order, like the diary you kept in elementary school. It is a chronicle of those years.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chronicle
circuitous,deviating from a straight course,"Circuitous means indirect or roundabout. If you're already late for school, you'll want to take the straightest, fastest way there, not a circuitous one!","Circuitous comes from the Latin word circuitus meaning ""a going around."" If you're being circuitous it's like you're going around and around in circles. It can also refer to someone's manner or speech, if they are not being direct. For example, if you want someone to get you another piece of cake, but just you sit there looking longingly at your empty plate and talking about how delicious cake is, then you're being circuitous. And annoying.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/circuitous
circumlocution,an indirect way of expressing something,"Circumlocution is a long, complicated word which means a long, complicated way of expressing something. To cut to the chase, circumlocution means to beat around the bush.","Circumlocution comes from the Latin words circum, ""circle,"" and loqui, ""to speak."" So circumlocution is speaking in circles, going round and round in a wordy way without ever getting to the heart of the matter. It's an evasive style of argument, best employed when you really don't want to say what's on your mind.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/circumlocution
circumscribe,draw a line around,"To circumscribe is to limit or restrict. If you spend too much time watching TV instead of fulfilling other obligations, you might circumscribe your TV-watching time to one hour daily (or two hours, if your favorite show is on).","Circumscribe comes from the Latin words circum, meaning ""around,"" and scribere, meaning ""to write."" If the word circumscribe causes you to think of geometry class, give yourself a pat on the back. In geometry, circumscribe means to draw one geometric figure around another figure so that the two figures touch but don’t intersect. If you studied geometry but this sounds unfamiliar, perhaps you should have taken our advice about watching too much TV.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/circumscribe
circumspect,careful to consider potential consequences and avoid risk,"If you are circumspect, you think carefully before doing or saying anything. A good quality in someone entrusted with responsibility, though sometimes boring in a friend.","The word circumspect was borrowed from Latin circumspectus, from circumspicere, ""to be cautious."" The basic meaning of Latin circumspicere is ""to look around."" Near synonyms are prudent and cautious, though circumspect implies a careful consideration of all circumstances and a desire to avoid mistakes and bad consequences.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/circumspect
circumvent,surround so as to force to give up,To circumvent is to avoid. Someone who trains elephants but somehow gets out of picking up after them has found a way to circumvent the cleaning of the circus tent.,"Circum in Latin means ""around"" or ""round about,"" and vent- comes from venire, ""to come,"" but painting a picture from these two parts of the word helps. Picture someone circling around a barrier instead of climbing over it. That's what you do when you circumvent. You find a smart way around rules or barriers, or avoid doing something unpleasant altogether.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/circumvent
civil,not rude,"Civil has several meanings. The simplest is cultured and polite, as in someone who is civilized. Civil can also describe things related to a community of people and their government, or a civilization.","If you work for the post office, you're a civil servant. The Civil Rights movement focused on the notion that all American citizens were entitled to the same basic personal rights and freedoms. Civil wars are named in reference to the fact that conflict occurs between citizens of the same country, and civil law is similarly limited to non-criminal issues that community members have with each other. The Latin root, civilis, means both ""relating to a citizen"" and ""courteous.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/civil
clemency,leniency and compassion shown toward offenders,Say you're playing a role-playing game and you end up in one of the other player's dungeons. You could try begging her for clemency — compassion shown by people in power towards people who rebel or break the law.,"Clemency is also a weather word, though nowadays it's much more common to hear people talk about ""inclement weather"" than, say, ""the clemency of the storm."" Derived from the Latin for ""gentle"", it came into usage in the 1550s. If you have trouble remembering its meaning, get rid of the ""cle"" and replace the ""n"" with an ""r"". You're left with ""mercy"", which more or less means the same thing.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/clemency
cliche,a trite or obvious remark,"If you've heard an expression a million times, chances are it's a cliche.","Cliche, also spelled cliché, is a 19th century borrowed word from the French which refers to a saying or expression that has been so overused that it has become boring and unoriginal. Think about the expressions ""easy as pie,"" or ""don't play with fire,"" or ""beauty is skin deep."" These are all cliches. A plot or action sequence in a film or novel can also be called a cliche if it has become dull and predictable through overuse.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cliche
clique,an exclusive circle of people with a common purpose,"A clique is an exclusive group of people or friends. Before Rudolph pulled Santa's sled through the fog, the clique of flying reindeer never let him play their reindeer games.","In high school, the exclusive nature of cliques causes a lot of hurt feelings. Clique carries this less than nice feeling with it wherever it goes, whether it be a set of elites who surround a government official, a group of popular kids who don't let others join their group or the closed circle of people at the office who always make sure they get the best jobs.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/clique
coalesce,fuse or cause to come together,Waiting for a plan to come together? You're waiting for it to coalesce. Coalesce is when different elements of something join together and become one.,"In coalesce, you see co-, which should tell you the word means ""together."" The other half of the word comes from alescere, a Latin verb meaning ""to grow up."" So if you are trying to start up a photography club at school, once you have an advisor, some interested students and support from the administration, things will be coalescing or growing together. Another way to remember that? An adolescent is one who is growing. A lot!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/coalesce
coerce,cause to do through pressure or necessity,"You can bring a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. You can coerce — or pressure — someone to attend your office holiday party, but you can't make him have fun.","If you're at a point where you feel like you need to coerce someone into doing something, it might be more civilized to just give up. To coerce is to manipulate, use aggressive arguments, pressure unfairly, or threaten — really, this isn't very civilized behavior, is it? Handy synonyms for this verb include force and pressure. In a gangster film, you might hear a character say he ""put the squeeze"" on someone — another way of saying he coerced them.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/coerce
cogent,powerfully persuasive,"When you make a cogent argument, it means your argument is clear and persuasive. In these days of 24-hour entertainment news and sound-bite sized explanations of complex government policy, it’s hard to find a cogent argument amidst all the emotional outbursts.","Cogent comes from a Latin word meaning to drive together, so cogent thinking is well-organized: it hangs together. If you try to convince your mayor to build a new park by saying that playgrounds are good, seeing the sky is nice, and raccoons are cool…well that’s not a cogent argument; it’s just random. But you could cogently argue that parks contribute to civic happiness by providing space for exercise, community, and encounters with nature.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cogent
cognitive,relating to or involving the mental process of knowing,"If it's related to thinking, it's considered cognitive. Anxious parents might defend using flashcards with toddlers as ""nurturing their cognitive development.""","The adjective, cognitive, comes from the Latin cognoscere ""to get to know"" and refers to the ability of the brain to think and reason as opposed to feel. A child's cognitive development is the growth in his or her ability to think and solve problems. Many English words that involve knowing and knowledge have cogn- in them such as cognizant ""aware of"" and recognize ""to know someone in the present because you knew them from the past.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cognitive
cognizant,having or showing knowledge or understanding or realization,"If you are cognizant of what's going on at the table behind you in the lunchroom, that means you know they're plotting to throw peas at your head. If you are cognizant of something, you are aware of or informed about it.","This 19th century adjective derives from Latin cognōscere, ""to learn."" For the English adjective and noun, an older pronunciation with a silent g was in use in legal contexts up until the early 20th century. In law, these terms refer to jurisdiction, or the right of a court to hear a case.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cognizant
coherent,sticking together,"Something coherent is logical and clear. ""I told you if you didn't do your homework you couldn't watch TV. You didn't do your homework so you can't watch TV."" This is a coherent argument (and annoying as well).","The thing about such coherent arguments, as your Mom well knows, is that they are also easily and clearly understood. If someone speaks coherently, they are speaking clearly and lucidly. A slight variation on the meaning comes in the sense of something that is united clearly as a whole and a recognizable entity. You might say, for example, that New York City is a ""culturally coherent region"" within the United States.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/coherent
colloquial,characteristic of informal spoken language or conversation,"Colloquial language is casual and conversational: it's the difference between ""What are you going to do?"" and ""Whatchagonnado?""","The word colloquial comes from the Latin word colloquium, which means ""speaking together."" The roots are the prefix com-, which means ""together,"" and the suffix -loqu, which means ""speak."" Some may think that colloquial language is not good, when in fact it may just not be appropriate for the context. While it is OK to be colloquial and chatty with friends, it is not acceptable to be colloquial in an essay for school or work.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/colloquial
collusion,secret agreement,"If you are making secret agreements with someone, then you are in collusion with them. Every time gas prices jump, consumers suspect the gas station owners of collusion and price fixing.","The noun collusion almost always implies that plans are being made because of some nefarious, most likely illegal, purpose. An art thief could be in collusion with a museum director to steal a famous painting from an art museum. Things get sticky when there is collusion between government and business, between union and management, or between your siblings.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/collusion
compelling,driving or forcing,"Compelling means attractive, or irresistible, or really, really convincing. You know your argument for backpacking across Europe is compelling when your parents not only let you go but also pay for all your expenses.",To compel is to drive or force into action––you mom could compel you to finish your homework by threatening not to feed you until it's done. A compelling argument compels you to agree with its logic––it's irresistible. That cute skirt you’ve been eyeing for months is now 75% off? The price is a compelling reason to buy the skirt.,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/compelling
compendium,a concise but comprehensive summary of a larger work,"When you search an online encyclopedia, you are searching a compendium of information on just about everything. A compendium is a comprehensive collection of something.","You can also use the word compendium to describe a collection of written works. If you gather all of the anecdotes your parents and grandparents have told you into a book, you'll have created a compendium of family stories. The plural of compendium is either compendiums or compendia.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/compendium
complacent,contented to a fault with oneself or one's actions,Someone who is complacent has become overly content — the junk-food-eating couch potato might be feeling complacent about his health.,"The literal meaning of this word's Latin root is ""very pleased,"" but even though complacent people may seem pleased with themselves, we are rarely pleased with them. They are unconcerned by things that should concern them, and they may neglect their duties. A complacent person might be heard saying, ""Ehh, don't worry about it!"" — when there really is something to worry about.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/complacent
complement,something added to embellish or make perfect,A complement is something that makes up a satisfying whole with something else. Those shiny red shoes you just bought complement your shiny red purse.,"Complement comes from the Latin complementum, ""something that fills up or completes."" Complement keeps both the e and the meaning. It's also a verb; if you and your partner complement each other, you make a perfect pair. Something that complements completes or adds a little something.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/complement
complicity,guilt as a confederate in a crime or offense,Complicity is involvement in a wrongful act — like when you drove your newly-turned-vegetarian friend to a fast food joint so that she could scarf down a hamburger.,"Complicity refers to the act of helping someone else behave inappropriately or illegally. If you find yourself accused of complicity, it's often helpful to show that you were unaware of the other person's intentions. In the case of the trip to the fast food restaurant, that's going to be hard to prove. You'll probably be scorned for being an accomplice, or someone who is complicit, in your friend's shameful act.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/complicity
comprehensive,including all or everything,"When you want to describe something that includes all or most details, you can use the adjective comprehensive. If you get the comprehensive treatment at a spa, it might include massage, manicure and a facial.","Comprehensive is from Latin comprehensivus, from comprehensus, the source of English comprehend. In business, comprehensive insurance is insurance that covers a broad range, offering protection against most risks of a certain type. It applies mainly to car insurance.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/comprehensive
comprise,be made of,"When something comprises other things, it is made up of them or formed from them. The periodic table comprises 118 elements, because the whole comprises the parts.","In its traditional use, the word comprise is the opposite of compose: if A comprises X, Y, and Z, then X, Y, and Z compose A. But because compose and comprise sound so much alike, people have long confused the two. So now you often hear things like ""The band is comprised of a guitarist, a bassist, and a hairy drummer,"" whereas sticklers would prefer ""is composed of"" in that sentence. The word is undergoing a usage shift, making it just as hairy as that drummer!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/comprise
conciliatory,making or willing to make concessions,"If you're in a fight with a friend and you want to end it, you should make a conciliatory gesture, such as inviting her to a party you're having. Conciliatory describes things that make other people less angry.","The context is often a situation in which a dispute is settled by compromise. A synonym is propitiatory, though this adjective usually refers to avoiding the anger of someone who has the power to harm. In the word conciliatory, the –ory suffix means ""relating to or doing,"" and the root is from Latin conciliatus, from conciliare ""to bring together, win over,"" from concilium ""council.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/conciliatory
concise,expressing much in few words,"If something is concise, it's short and gets right to the point. A concise edition of your diary might be 50 pages of the most important entries.","Concise comes from the Latin word concidere, which means to cut down. When we use concise, we're talking about words that have been cut down. There are no concise trees, but there are concise works of political philosophy. A concise Italian-English dictionary, is shorter than an unabridged one. If you're good at quick explanations, you have a concise manner. A good synonym is succinct.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/concise
concord,a harmonious state of things and of their properties,"A concord is an agreement. If you want to watch a romantic comedy and your date wants to watch a horror film, you might compromise and come to a concord by agreeing to watch an action comedy.","Concord can be used as a verb meaning ""to arrange by agreement,"" but this usage is rare. Much more common is concord used as a noun. The United Nations could work tirelessly to establish a concord between warring nations, or you might even work to establish a concord among the warring factions on your cheerleading team. A concord brings peace and harmony — just like a peace treaty.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/concord
concurrent,occurring or operating at the same time,"Concurrent means happening at the same time, as in two movies showing at the same theater on the same weekend.","You might notice another adjective, current, in concurrent. While current refers to something that is happening right now, concurrent describes two or more things happening at the same time. A prisoner who is serving two concurrent five-year sentences will serve those prison terms together, meaning that he'll probably get out of jail in five years rather than ten. To help you remember the meaning of concurrent, imagine two parallel kayaks being carried down a river by the current at the same time.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/concurrent
condescend,behave in a patronizing manner,"A snooty waiter might condescend to serve you dinner at a fancy restaurant, meaning that he'd consider himself far too important to carry out the mundane task of delivering your hamburger and fries.","You might have noticed that condescend contains the word descend, meaning to move down from a higher place. You can think of condescend as lowering yourself to do a task that you feel is far beneath you. Kings and queens would never condescend to do their own laundry at the palace, for example. If they even knew how to do the laundry, you can be sure they'd do it in a condescending, or superior, way to let everyone know that housework is no task for a monarch.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/condescend
condone,"excuse, overlook, or make allowances for","If you condone something, you allow it, approve of it, or at least can live with it. Some teachers condone chewing gum, and some don't.","Things that are condoned are allowed, even if everyone isn't exactly thrilled about it. People often say, ""I don't condone what he did, but I understand it."" Condoning is like excusing something. People seem to talk more about things they don't condone than things they do condone. Your mom might say, ""I don't condone you staying up till 10, but I know you need to read."" That's a way of giving approval and not giving approval at the same time.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/condone
conducive,tending to bring about; being partly responsible for,Conducive means tending to cause or produce something. Regular exercise is conducive to happiness and a feeling of well-being.,"This adjective is usually followed by the preposition to, and it refers to bringing about something favorable or helpful: A positive attitude is conducive to good health. Conducive was formed in English from the less common verb conduce ""to lead or contribute to a result."" The verb conduce descends from Middle English conducen, from Latin conducere, from the prefix com- ""together"" plus ducere ""to lead."" And the suffix –ive means ""tending to.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/conducive
confluence,a place where things merge or flow together,"Confluence means a flowing together. In a literal sense, it's about rivers. But it's more often used to talk about the coming together of factors or ideas, or of cultures in a diverse city.","Con- means ""with,"" and -fluence sounds like ""flow."" When things come together like rivers do, flowing from entirely different places, you call that a confluence. If the senior class needs to raise money for a class trip, and the drama club is looking for someone to do concessions during intermission at the school play, that's a confluence of factors.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/confluence
congenial,suitable to your needs,"A congenial person is easy to get along with. If you're trying to decide which of your friends to take on a road trip, choose the most congenial one.","Congenial means sharing the same temperament, or agreeing with your temperament. You can talk about a congenial person, place, or environment. Maybe you enjoy the congenial atmosphere of the library. Or perhaps for you the disco is more congenial. As you might expect for such a vaguely approving word, there are many synonyms: agreeable, pleasant, delectable, delightful, enjoyable, and so on.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/congenial
commensurate,corresponding in size or degree or extent,"The word commensurate has to do with things that are similar in size and therefore appropriate. Many people think the death penalty is a commensurate punishment for murder. In other words, the penalty fits the crime.","When things are commensurate, they're fair, appropriate, and the right size. If you got a ticket for jaywalking, you shouldn't get ten years in prison — that penalty is not commensurate with the crime. The word commensurate is usually followed by with or to; one thing is commensurate with or to another.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/commensurate
congenital,present at birth but not necessarily hereditary,"Congenital refers to something present at birth but not necessarily inherited from the parents. Babies with heart disorders developed in utero can live long and productive lives, in spite of their congenital birth defect.","Congenital derives from the Latin genus, to beget. Something that is present at one’s begetting, during fetal development, or at birth is congenital. Fetal alcohol syndrome, which develops in fetuses if their mothers are drinking heavily while pregnant, is a congenital disorder. You might also use congenital to describe something seemingly inborn ""a congenital sense of humor,"" or a ""congenital faith.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/congenital
congregate,"come together, usually for a purpose","Congregate is a verb that means to come together, to assemble, or to gather. At school dances, you may congregate with your friends, because you get nervous in front of kids you don't know very well.","Congregate comes from Latin root words com, meaning ""together"" and gregare, meaning ""to gather in a flock."" Congregation, or a gathering or assembly, comes from the same roots, as does gregarious, an adjective describing someone who likes to gather with others to socialize. If you remember the key word is flock — what ministers often call their congregations — you should have no trouble remembering congregate means to flock together.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/congregate
conjecture,the formation of conclusions from incomplete evidence,"Can you guess what conjecture means? It's a word to use when you are not sure of something and have to ""guess or surmise.""","You can see how the word conjecture means that you create a theory or opinion about something without basing it in fact because the original definition of conjecture, from Old French, is ""interpretation of signs and omens."" Since signs and omens are pretty subjective, it makes sense that the word would then move to its current meaning. However, even though it only seems like weather reports are conjectures, they are actually based on evidence!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/conjecture
conjure,summon into action or bring into existence,"If your mom can magically conjure up the most delicious meals from the most random ingredients in the kitchen, she might just be the best cook in the neighborhood.","Sometimes the mere sight or smell of something can conjure or stir up long lost memories, magically transporting you back to another place and time. But in the early 13th century, conjure was a bit more sinister — it meant using a spell to capture a demon to do one's bidding. In our modern day, conjure still carries the meaning of summoning a spirit, but it more regularly means to summon an idea or bring something into existence.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/conjure
connoisseur,an expert able to appreciate a field,"A connoisseur is a person who, through study and interest, has a fine appreciation for something, like the connoisseur who can identify the clarinet player on a jazz recording by the sound of his inhalations alone.","A connoisseur is an authority in his field, someone who has expert knowledge and training, especially in the arts. A connoisseur may also be someone with an extremely developed sense of taste, like the connoisseur who can identify rare wine by a flavor others can't even detect. Then again, some people call themselves connoisseurs of just about anything they like — pizza, old vinyl albums, even cartoons — because they know so much about it.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/connoisseur
consecrate,"give entirely to a specific person, activity, or cause","Consecrate means to make holy or to dedicate to a higher purpose. You need to consecrate a building to turn it into a church, but you can also consecrate a week in New York City to the pursuit of the perfect bagel.","The secr part of consecrate comes from the Latin sacer ""sacred."" Remember that something consecrated is dedicated to God and thus sacred. And then remember that the meanings of words tend to stretch; over time this one moved from ""dedicated to God"" to ""dedicated to whatever"": jelly donuts, the perfect tan, finding a solution to Rubik's Cube.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/consecrate
consensus,agreement in the judgment reached by a group as a whole,"When there's a consensus, everyone agrees on something. If you're going to a movie with friends, you need to reach a consensus about which movie everyone wants to see.","Ever notice how people disagree about just about everything, from who's the best baseball player to how high taxes should be? Whenever there's disagreement, there's no consensus: consensus means everyone is on the same page. When you're talking about all the people in the world, it's hard to find a consensus on anything. There are just too many opinions. However, in a smaller group, reaching a consensus is possible.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/consensus
consonant,involving or characterized by harmony,"A consonant is a speech sound that is not a vowel. It also refers to letters of the alphabet that represent those sounds: Z, B, T, G, and H are all consonants.","Consonants are all the non-vowel sounds, or their corresponding letters: A, E, I, O, U and sometimes Y are not consonants. In hat, H and T are consonants. Consonant can also be an adjective that describes things that seem like they should go together, things that are ""agreeable."" You could say a nation's offer of aid is consonant with their treaties. When you hear consonant sounds in music, they are pleasing, the opposite of ""dissonant"" sounds which are harsh.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/consonant
construe,make sense of; assign a meaning to,"If you interpret something or make sense of it, you construe its meaning. If the new girl in your class asks to sit with you at lunch, you could construe that she wants to be friends. You can never have too many friends!","To make an assumption based on evidence is to construe. You could construe that eating an entire box of cookies might make you feel a bit sick. And you might not want to eat them again for a very long time. The opposite of construe is misconstrue, which means to falsely or wrongly interpret.

To consummate means to bring something to completion, but it often refers specifically to making a marriage complete by having sexual relations.

contentious,showing an inclination to disagree,"A contentious issue is one that people are likely to argue about, and a contentious person is someone who likes to argue or fight.","Some issues — like abortion, the death penalty, and gun control — are very controversial. They're also contentious, because people tend to argue about them, and the arguments will probably go on forever. Contentious issues get people angry and in a fighting mood. On the other hand, some people always seem to be in a fighting mood, no matter what the issue is. People like that are contentious too.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/contentious
contiguous,having a common boundary or edge,"Use the adjective contiguous when you want to describe one thing touching another thing, or next to it but not actually touching.","Things that are contiguous are near or next to but not actually touching and yet they are also defined as ""touching, sharing a border."" You can use this adjective to describe people or things related to and nearby others. It comes from the Latin word contiguus, which means pretty much the same thing, ""bordering upon."" Because the word has two meanings that are very similar but not always the same it can be a bit confusing. This is an example of what's called ""semantic ambiguity,"" when something can mean more than one thing or a word or phrase is not precise.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/contiguous
contingent,possible but not certain to occur,The adjective contingent can be used to describe something that can occur only when something else happens first. Making money is contingent on finding a good-paying job.,"When an event or situation is contingent, it means that it depends on some other event or fact.

In the field of theology being contrite is ""being remorseful for past sin and resolved to avoid future sin.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/contrite

If you can easily predict the final minutes of a made-for-TV movie, then call it contrived.","The adjective contrived describes something that is artificially planned, especially in an obvious way, so it comes across as faked or forced. It's not just drama that can come off as contrived. Someone's speech habits, wardrobe, or even personality can seem contrived.

conventional,following accepted customs and proprieties,"Conventional is an adjective for things that are normal, ordinary, and following the accepted way. Ho-hum.","This word describes what is typical and ordinary and that which follows accepted standards of behavior or taste.

convivial,occupied with or fond of the pleasures of good company,"Use the adjective convivial to describe your friend who is ""the life of the party.""","The Latin word convivium means ""a feast,"" and when convivial was first coined in the 1660s, its meaning related to the excess of food and drink during such celebrations. You can also see convivial in convivere, meaning ""to carouse together.""

After all, a big part of feasting is being with people you care about.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/convivial
copious,large in number or quantity,"If you have a copious amount of something, you have a lot of it. If you take copious notes, you'll do well when it comes time for review sessions — unless you can't read your own handwriting.","Copious comes from the Latin copia, meaning ""abundance."" You can use copious for something quantitative, like your copious admirers, or for something qualitative, like the copious gratitude you feel for your admirers.

corollary,an inference following from the proof of another proposition,Corollary describes a result that is the natural consequence of something else. You could say that your renewed love of books is a corollary to the recent arrival of a book store in your neighborhood.,"The noun corollary describes an action's consequence, such as having to study more, a corollary to getting a bad grade.

corroborate,give evidence for,"To corroborate is to back someone else’s story. If you swear to your teacher that you didn't throw the spitball, and your friends corroborate your story by promising that you were concentrating on math homework, she might actually believe you.","For example, a witness in court corroborates the testimony of others, and further experimentation can corroborate a scientific theory. Near synonyms are substantiate and confirm.

cosmopolitan,composed of people from many parts of the world,"Your Aunt Eleanor, who's lived in six different countries and speaks four languages fluently, might be described as cosmopolitan, or comfortable and familiar with different cultures and people.","People who are cosmopolitan have an air of glamour surrounding them, a sense that they've seen a lot of the world and are sophisticated and at ease with all different kinds of people. Places can also be described as cosmopolitan, meaning ""diverse,"" or bustling with lots of people of varying nationalities. Any way you use it, cosmopolitan implies a sophistication, which might explain why both a well-known alcoholic cocktail and a famous women's magazine are both named after the word cosmopolitan.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cosmopolitan
countenance,the appearance conveyed by a person's face,"The noun countenance means the face or its expression. If you're a great poker player, you probably have a calm countenance.","Countenance comes from a French word for ""behavior,"" but it has become a fancy term for either the expression of a face or the face itself: ""He had a puzzled countenance,"" or ""what a charming countenance!""

coup,a sudden and decisive change of government by force,"A coup is a pretty major achievement, whether it involves taking over a government by force, or landing a major business contract.","When the word coup is used on the nightly news, it's usually describing a military government takeover.

covenant,a signed written agreement between two or more parties,"A covenant is an agreement between two people, or companies, or even countries. It is formal, solemn, sometimes even sacred.","There are some places where you'll hear covenant get used. It's a little old fashioned and formal, but marriage is often referred to as a covenant.

covert,secret or hidden,Covert means secret or hidden. Soldiers might take part in a covert mission to infiltrate an enemy camp — and you might take part in a covert mission to steal your brother's leftover Halloween candy.,"Covert is the opposite of overt, which means obvious, or in full view. Covert things are hidden, private, or stealthy. It comes from the Old French covert, or ""covered."" A covert bag of chips you've snuck into the movie theater might literally be covered, hidden under your coat, while a covert plan to throw your dad a surprise party is just a secret.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/covert
covet,"wish, long, or crave for","If you covet something, you eagerly desire something that someone else has. If it's 95 degrees out and humid, you may find yourself coveting your neighbor's air conditioner.","If the word covet sounds familiar, you're thinking of the Tenth Commandment: ""Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's."" Basically this means you should be happy with your electronic gadgets and not be jealous when a friend gets something better.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/covet
credulous,disposed to believe on little evidence,People who believe things easily without having to be convinced are credulous. Sales people are always hoping that someone credulous picks up the phone during a sales call.,"Credulous comes from the 16th-century Latin credulus, or ""easily believes."" A synonym for credulous is gullible, and both terms describe a person who accepts something willingly without a lot of supporting facts. Calling someone credulous can imply that the person is naive and simple. An individual isn't necessarily insulted by being called credulous, though, because some objects of belief, like religions and unicorns, come with a willing leap of faith for believing in what is unseen.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/credulous
criterion,the ideal in terms of which something can be judged,"A criterion is a standard for judging something. If you are holding a cupcake competition, your number one criterion might be the smoothness of frosting.","A criterion is a category for judging, but can also be a prerequisite for an achievement.

Likewise, if you establish the model for something, say you deliver an exciting, profound graduation speech, we might say you ""set the criterion"" for future speakers.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/criterion
cryptic,having a secret or hidden meaning,"""White bunny. Moon. Square."" Do you understand what that means? Of course not! It's totally cryptic. Cryptic comments or messages are hard to understand because they seem to have a hidden meaning.","Cryptic is from Late Latin crypticus, from Greek kryptikos, from kryptos ""hidden."" This Greek adjective is the source of our English word crypt, referring to a room under a church in which dead people are buried. That might account for why the word cryptic has an eerie tone to it.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cryptic
culinary,of or relating to or used in cooking,"Culinary means having to do with cooking or the kitchen. If you go to culinary school, you're learning how to cook, most likely because you want to work as a chef.","If you have a culinary streak, you might love cooking for your friends or maybe just watching cooking shows on TV.

culminate,"end, especially to reach a final or climactic stage","The verb culminate is used to describe a high point or a climactic stage in a process. For example, the goal of a Major League baseball team is to have their season culminate in a World Series victory.","The word culminate derives from the Latin word culminatus, the past participle of culminare, which means ""to top or crown.""

culpable,deserving blame or censure as being wrong or injurious,"If a child tells his mother he was not to blame for the cookie jar being broken, she could still find him culpable if he was the only one home. Culpable means to be at fault.","Culpable is being deserving of blame. If you are culpable of a crime, you are the culprit, or the one who did it. Culpable can be used when looking for the root of the problem rather than a simple who done it. If a teacher leaves the room during a difficult test, and the students decide to cheat, parents might ask whether or not the teacher was also somewhat culpable for the outcome.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/culpable
cursory,hasty and without attention to detail; not thorough,"No reason to get excited — cursory has nothing to do with bad language. Instead, it means not paying attention to details, like friends who are so busy studying for a test that they only give your new haircut a cursory glance.","Cursory dates to the early 17th century, from the French word cursoire meaning ""rapid,"" which comes from the Latin word cursorius, meaning ""hasty, of a race or running.""

A teacher might take a cursory look at a pile of completed tests, not to grade them, but to see if anyone attempted the bonus questions.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cursory
curtail,terminate or abbreviate before its intended or proper end,"To curtail something is to slow it down, put restrictions on it, or stop it entirely. If I give up cake, I am curtailing my cake-eating.","Curtail is an official-sounding word for stopping or slowing things down. The police try to curtail crime — they want there to be less crime in the world. A company may want to curtail their employees' computer time, so they spend more time working and less time goofing around. Teachers try to curtail whispering and note-passing in class. When something is curtailed, it's either stopped entirely or stopped quite a bit — it's cut short.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/curtail
cynic,someone who is critical of the motives of others,A cynic is someone who believes that humans are selfish and that they only do something if it will benefit themselves. Cynics criticize acts of kindness and will probably tease you if you help an old lady cross the street.,"Maybe you know a cynic or two. They like to criticize people and situations, especially if they think there’s a deeper motivation behind the more obvious one. Let’s say a friend borrows your car, and then he shows up later covered in grease and offers you a lollipop. If you’re a cynic, you’d suspect that your friend crashed your car and is trying to distract you with the delicious and sweet lollipop. And you might be right.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cynic
daunt,cause to lose courage,"Daunt means to frighten or scare off. The Cowardly Lion's efforts to daunt Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man were less than successful.","Daunt rhymes with haunt, another word which means to frighten, though in a creepier sense. Walking through your neighbors' haunted house on Halloween might daunt your little brother, even though he's unlikely to encounter anything scarier than plastic skeletons and ghosts made of sheets. Daunt often shows up as part of the adjective undaunted, which describes someone who remains unafraid or perseveres in the face of scary circumstances.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/daunt
dearth,an insufficient quantity or number,"If there is a dearth of something, there is not enough of it. A dearth of cupcakes is unfortunate, but a dearth of nutritious food is a serious problem.","Dearth is an Old English noun formed from the adjective deore, ""precious, costly,"" and the noun-forming suffix -th. Though the relationship of dearth meaning ""lack, insufficient amount"" to the adjective dear is not so obvious, it is still easy to imagine that something precious is probably also in short supply. Dearth is used almost exclusively in the phrase ""a dearth of.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/dearth
debacle,a sudden and complete disaster,"Use debacle to refer to a fiasco, disaster, or great failure. If several dogs run onto the field during the big baseball game, tripping players and chewing up the bases, you can call the whole event a debacle.","Debacle is sometimes used to describe a military defeat. If your army retreats, that's one thing. If your army is outmaneuvered and ends up huddled in a valley, surrounded on all sides by the enemy, forced to sing 70s sitcom theme songs by their savage captors––that's a debacle. Debacle comes from French débâcler ""to clear,"" from Middle French desbacler, from the prefix des- ""completely, utterly"" plus bacler ""to block.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/debacle
debauchery,a wild gathering involving drinking and promiscuity,"Debauchery is a noun meaning crazy partying and wild nights, usually accompanied by a lot of alcohol. So you probably don't want to engage in any kind of debauchery the night before an exam.","Debauchery is all about indulging in some of life's pleasures — overindulging, in fact. It stems from the Middle French word debaucher, which means to “entice from work or duty.” So imagine workers being tempted from another day at the office by the promise of a wild bender in Vegas. Or college kids putting down the books and heeding the siren call of the frat party downstairs.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/debauchery
debilitate,make weak,"To debilitate something is to make it weaker. A bad flu may debilitate your powers of concentration, like the New Year's resolutions that temporarily debilitate bakeries' business.","The verb debilitate traces back to the Latin word debilis, meaning “lame, disabled, crippled.” It’s often used to describe what disability or illness does to a person's health, but it can describe anything that has been weakened, like the sense of community that is slowly debilitated by people working longer hours and the lack of sidewalks that in many towns make it harder to walk around and meet the neighbors.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/debilitate
decadent,marked by excessive self-indulgence and moral decay,"If your friend vacations in lavish hotels, wears thousand-dollar shoes, and refuses to eat cheese that costs less than $20 an ounce, you might say her lifestyle is decadent.","A decadent is a person who has fallen into a state of moral or artistic decay. Typically, though, we use decadent as an adjective to describe wasteful indulgence or extravagance. Celebrities who find themselves unable to manage sudden fame and fortune sometimes go overboard, throwing million-dollar parties, living the fast life, turning to drugs and alcohol. And because they're famous, we read about them and their decadent lifestyles in the tabloid papers.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/decadent
decimate,kill in large numbers,"If something is drastically reduced or killed, especially in number, you can say it was decimated. ""The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico decimated the wildlife along the coast.""","The verb decimate originally referred to a form of capital punishment for Roman troops. If there was a rebellion, one out of every ten men (thus the dec in decimate) was put to death. So the word's first expanded usage was to mean a ten percent reduction or a ten percent tax. Modern usage gives the word decimate its ""drastically reduced"" meaning, but the verb can also be used to mean ""to wipe out"" or ""to eliminate.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/decimate
decorous,characterized by propriety and dignity and good taste,"Something that is decorous is dignified, proper, and in good taste, like your decorous great-aunt who always wears a dress — even when she's only headed to the grocery store.","The adjective decorous shares its origins with decoration.

deduce,reason from the general to the particular,"To deduce is to figure something out based on what you already know. When you see a person crying, it's easy to deduce that the person is sad. Unless they're happy, of course. Sometimes happy people cry.","Derived from the Latin ducere, meaning ""to lead,"" a person who deduces something is ""leading"" their mind from one idea to the next. Deduction is a noun from the verb deduce: it's what we call something that we learn when we deduce. Sherlock Holmes, the famous investigator created by Arthur Conan Doyle, was a master of deduction. He could deduce from a few small clues all of the facts of a murder case.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/deduce
defame,charge falsely or with malicious intent,"Even though Joan Jett sang about not minding her bad reputation, most of us don't want others to defame us. To defame is to gossip, even if the story is made-up, with the goal of hurting someone's image.","We usually think of fame as a positive thing. Love, admiration, and people wanting to be like you — it all comes with the territory. The de- in defame means ""remove."" So if someone tries to defame a person, fame — or a good reputation — is taken away. Celebrities protect themselves from those who want to defame them, arming themselves with lawyers.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/defame
deference,a disposition or tendency to yield to the will of others,"Sure you wear ripped jeans to school every day, but you don't wear them to your grandmother's house out of deference to her. When you show deference to someone, you make a gesture of respect.","The noun deference goes with the verb defer, which means ""to yield to someone's opinions or wishes out of respect for that person.""

You're taking his route out of deference to his opinion and greater experience.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/deference
definitive,clearly formulated,"A definitive answer is a final one. A definitive decision by a court of law is one that will not be changed. A definitive translation is one everyone turns to as correct. Definitive means authoritative, conclusive, final.","Be careful not to confuse definitive with definite. Definite means clearly defined.

degenerate,grow worse,"If something degenerates, it gets worse, like a food fight that degenerates to an all-out spaghetti-throwing war. Degenerate can also describe an immoral person — or the behavior of such a person.","Whether used as a verb, noun, or adjective, degenerate carries a sense of making worse or declining to a lower state. People who are degenerate, or who exhibit degenerate behavior, are often set apart from others, in part out of fear that their influence will degenerate the morals of the impressionable people around them.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/degenerate
deleterious,harmful to living things,"If something is deleterious, it does harm or makes things worse. Smoking has obvious deleterious effects on your health, not to mention your social life.","My parents were worried that their divorce would have a deleterious effect on us kids, but in the end it was less harmful than watching them fight all the time. For most plants, a lack of sunlight has very deleterious consequences, but there are some plants that actually do very well in the dark. It's a wonder, given how well-established the science is, that we continue to do things that are deleterious to the fragile ecosystem. We must be willing to live with the deleterious effects.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/deleterious
delineate,represented accurately or precisely,"Though you pronounce it duh-LIN-ee-ate, there is a ""line"" in the middle of delineate. This might help you remember that to delineate is to outline and define something in detail or with an actual marking of lines and boundaries.","When you create an outline for a paper it usually summarizes what you will detail later. You delineate the sections, or mark the heading lines, and when you write the details, you delineate the subject of each heading. So, to delineate is both to mark lines and to fill in the lines. Using a fence to divide properties or a carpet to claim your side of the bedroom also is a way to delineate, or mark, physical boundaries.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/delineate

If you delude yourself into thinking your mom's chocolate cake is low in fat, you'll be disappointed to find out it's made with two sticks of butter!","If you delude someone into thinking something, you are making a fool of them, or making them foolish.

deluge,"fill or cover completely, usually with water","Feeling overwhelmed, like you're underwater? You might be experiencing a deluge — like when you've been given a deluge of homework over vacation: a dozen term papers, two dozen books to read, and a mile-high stack of math problems.","The noun deluge is an overwhelming amount of something in general, such as work, people, or questions. Because of its Latin roots, however, in particular it means an overwhelming amount of water. It comes from diluvian, which means flood. The verb deluge similarly means to overwhelm or inundate with something, particularly water. The hurricane deluged the island with rain. A deluge isn't always a bad thing, however.

demagogue,a leader who seeks support by appealing to popular passions,A demagogue is someone who becomes a leader largely because of skills as a speaker or who appeals to emotions and prejudices.,"Though the Greek root for demagogue literally means ""a leader of the people,"" the word has for centuries had a negative connotation: it actually means a leader who has manipulated the emotions and prejudices of the rabble. The reason for the negative connotation is that in ancient Athens, ""the people"" were considered to be an uncivilized mob. Two of the most famous historical demagogues are said to be Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/demagogue
denizen,a person who inhabits a particular place,"A denizen is an inhabitant or frequenter of a particular place: a citizen of a country, a resident in a neighborhood, a maven of a museum, a regular at a bar, or, even, a plant that is naturalized in a region.","The noun denizen comes from words that mean “from” and “within” and is related to “citizen.” Denizen can be used when talking about any person or group of people that have a specific relationship with a place.

depravity,a corrupt or degenerate act or practice,"Depravity goes beyond mere bad behavior — it is a total lack of morals, values, and even regard for other living things, like the depravity of a serial killer.","You can see the verb deprave in depravity. To deprave is to make something bad, often to the point of moral corruption, like the parental fear that a bad influence will deprave their good kids.

deprecate,express strong disapproval of; deplore,"To deprecate is to show disapproval or to make someone feel unimportant by speaking to them disrespectfully, like seniors who deprecate younger students just for fun.","To deprecate is to diminish, or to oppose, like when someone deprecates your dream of climbing Mt. Everest by calling it ""a little walk up a hill."" Some people deprecate themselves, which is called being self-deprecating. People who are self-deprecating downplay their abilities because they are humble — or want to appear that way.

deride,treat or speak of with contempt,The verb deride means to speak to someone with contempt or show a low opinion of someone or something. A bully might constantly deride other kids in his class — which might lead to many afternoons spent in the principal's office.,"To ""ride"" people is to get on their case or give them a hard time, and to deride is to do the same with insulting language or poor treatment. Deride comes from the Latin root dērīdēre, meaning ""to ridicule, to scorn,"" and it's often used to express dislike or even hatred. Criticizing something with words is a common way to deride, and politicians often deride each other in their speeches during election campaigns.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/deride
derogatory,expressive of low opinion,"Something that's derogatory is insulting or disrespectful. If you make derogatory comments, that means you say things that are unflattering, unkind, or demeaning.","Derogatory means about the same as insulting. Derogatory language is meant to hurt, and it usually does. If you feel offended or insulted by what someone says, the person probably said something derogatory. Racial, sexist, and homophobic slurs are all derogatory. Insults that mean someone is stupid or crazy are derogatory. Making a joke about someone's mother is derogatory.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/derogatory
desiccate,lose water or moisture,"The verb desiccate means to dry out, dry up and dehydrate. It's helpful to desiccate weeds but certainly not crops.","As anyone who's been stuck in the desert will tell you, being desiccated by the burning sun isn't much fun.

Without desiccation, raisins or beef jerky would not be possible!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/desiccate

If you are depressed, you might describe your mood as despondent.","This adjective is often followed by over or about: ""He was despondent over the loss of his job.""

destitute,poor enough to need help from others,"When you think of the word destitute, which means poor or lacking other necessities of life, think of someone who is in desperate straits. A very, very tight budget is poor. Living on the streets is destitute.","Destitute essentially means not having something. When you're destitute in the sense of being poor, you're technically ""destitute of money."" You can be destitute of other things as well.

If you are applying for a job as a waitress but have never worked in a restaurant in any capacity, you're ""destitute of experience.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/destitute
desultory,"marked by lack of definite plan, purpose, or enthusiasm","If you lack a definite plan or purpose and flit from one thing to another, your actions are desultory. Some people call such desultory wanderings spontaneous. Others call it ""being lost.""","The adjective desultory comes from the word desultor, which was a circus rider who would leap from the back of one galloping horse onto another. From this literal sense of jumping from one thing to another, we get the modern meaning of desultory as jumping between things without a logical purpose.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/desultory
dexterous,skillful in physical movements; especially of the hands,"If you're dexterous, you're good with your hands. To be dexterous is an essential trait for knitters and sleight-of-hand magicians.","The adjective dexterous often refers to skill and agility with the hands, but it can mean any skillful or clever physical movement. A kid's dexterous ball handling and footwork can aid him on the soccer field. Dexterous can also be used to describe mental skill and agility — like the dexterous handling of an uncomfortable situation at work.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/dexterous
dialectical,relating to reasoning by the exchange of logical arguments,"Dialectical describes how someone goes about finding the truth. If you're an investigative journalist, you probably use dialectical reasoning.","You might think dialectical refers to how people speak in a certain region or in a specific group, such as a regional accent. That version of dialect comes from the Greek word dialektos, meaning ""discourse, way of speaking."" But dialectical instead comes from the French word dialecte, meaning ""denoting the art of investigating the truth of opinions."" It has to do with a method of reasoning used to determine the truth.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/dialectical
dictum,an authoritative declaration,"""You are what you eat"" is a dictum, and so is a law requiring you to curb your dog. A dictum is a formal pronouncement, a rule, or a statement that expresses a truth universally acknowledged.","Dictum dates from the 16th Century.

If the principal of your school issues a dictum declaring ""no jeans in school,"" it's time to go shopping.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/dictum
didactic,"instructive, especially excessively","When people are didactic, they're teaching or instructing. This word is often used negatively for when someone is acting too much like a teacher.","When you're didactic, you're trying to teach something. Just about everything teachers do is didactic: the same is true of coaches and mentors. Didactic is often used in a negative way. If you heard that a movie is overly didactic, that's probably not good. Most people want to see a story and be entertained when going to the movies, and if it feels like the movie is just telling you what to think, that's didactic in a bad way.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/didactic
diffident,lacking self-confidence,"The adjective diffident describes someone who is shy and lacking in self-confidence. If you are shy and have a diffident manner, you should probably not choose one of these professions: substitute teacher, stand-up comic, or lion-tamer.","Diffident can describe someone who is reserved and restrained. Some may mistake your diffident manner for coolness or aloofness. Although it may be in your nature to be diffident, you will find it impossible to remain so when you visit my family. They are a big, noisy, outgoing bunch and they will make you join in the fun until you let loose and open up. Don't say you weren't warned!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/diffident
digress,wander from a direct or straight course,"If we're talking about science fiction, and you suddenly go off on a long tangent about the cost of grape soda, you digress. When a person digresses, they stray from the topic.","It's easy to understand why you digressed from the main topic. You were incredibly excited, speeding on caffeine, and, let's face it, you've never been at a loss for words. Don't get me wrong: I love your wanderings — how you drift from one topic to the next, letting your mind explore. The problem was that the meeting was running late and there was no time to let you digress. I had to pull you back to the main topic. I didn't want our potential new partners to get the idea that these digressions were typical.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/digress
dilettante,an amateur engaging in an activity without serious intention,"Though dilettante might sound like a nice French word, don't use it on your friend who thinks he can play the guitar after several short lessons. A dilettante is an amateur, often one who pretends to be very knowledgeable.","The meaning of dilettante has changed since it was borrowed from the Italian in the mid 1700s. Originally, it meant ""lover of the arts,"" but began to take on a negative slant as the idea of doing something as a professional took hold strongly during the 18th century. A dilettante was a mere lover of art as opposed to one who did it professionally. Today, the word implies you're pretending to be more of an artist than you're interested in or capable of being, so if you call your friend who likes to paint a dilettante, it's like you're calling him or her a poser.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/dilettante
discern,detect with the senses,"If you can make out, pick out, or distinguish something, you can discern it. This is a word for recognizing and perceiving things.","Discerning has to do with being able to see or hear something. In a loud room, it can be hard to discern one person's voice. If there's not much light, you'll have trouble discerning the words on a page well enough to read. If you have sloppy handwriting, then it's hard to discern what you wrote. When you can discern something, you can tell what it is; you can identify it.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/discern
discreet,marked by prudence or modesty and wise self-restraint,"Discreet describes someone or something that is appropriately quiet, prudent, and restrained. If you are wearing a discreet gray suit, it is unlikely that anyone at that business meeting will notice you.","Often people use discreet not only to indicate modesty or carefulness, but also to show a sort of secretiveness along the lines of “You're going to keep this a secret, right?” If no one in your family knows that you like to dress up as a bear, but then your cousin finds out, you may ask him to please be discreet.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/discreet
discrete,constituting a separate entity or part,"Discrete means separate or divided. A discrete unit is a separate part of something larger. A room is a discrete space within a house, just as the crankshaft is a discrete part of a car engine.","If something is discrete, it has its own space. An ice cube comes from an ice tray, but it has its own discrete compartment. A student government might have discrete committees for different projects. Don't confuse discrete with its close cousin discreet, which means “appropriately private.” Billionaire Bruce Wayne, for example, is very discreet about his secret life as Batman. You could say Batman is a discrete, or separate, part of Bruce Wayne’s identity. Anything distinct and separated is discrete.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/discrete
discriminate,marked by the ability to see or make fine distinctions,"When you discriminate between two things, you can tell the difference between them and can tell them apart.","The ability to discriminate between similar objects is important. For example, if you want to be a good root farmer, it helps if you can discriminate between a turnip and a parsnip. However, some people take it too far and discriminate against other people, treating them differently based on their physical characteristics or abilities. To be able to discriminate between a turnip and a radish is good, but to discriminate against people is not.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/discriminate
disdain,lack of respect accompanied by a feeling of intense dislike,"If you feel that something isn't worthy of your consideration, you may disdain it (or treat it with disdain).","In Old French, deignier meant ""to treat something as worthy."" To disdain something, then, is to treat it with contempt: ""Management at [the company] displayed a certain disdain for safety and appeared to regard safety-conscious workers as wimps in the organization."" As a verb, disdain carries an air of self-righteousness not associated with similar words like despise, abhor, detest, loathe and scorn. So if you disdain something, you might reject it with a haughty scoff, ""Ha!""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/disdain
disinterested,unaffected by concern for one's own welfare,"If you can't decide whether to purchase the shirt with orange polka dots or the purple paisley-patterned one, you might seek input from a disinterested, or unbiased, party (who will probably tell you not to buy either one).","Depending on whom you ask, disinterested is either one of the most commonly misused words in the English language, or a perfect example of usage experts and English teachers being way too uptight. While everyone agrees that disinterested can mean “unbiased,” the debate rages on as to whether it can also mean “uninterested” or “indifferent.” Sticklers are vehemently opposed to this secondary meaning. (Of course, you’ll also find the disinterested — or uninterested? — folks who couldn’t care less.)",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/disinterested
disparage,express a negative opinion of,"If you haven't got anything nice to say, then it's time to disparage someone. It means to belittle or degrade a person or idea.","Disparage is a specific way to describe a certain kind of insult, the kind that secures the insulter's place as superior. It often refers to an opinion or criticism lobbed in print or via word of mouth, not necessarily an act done to someone's face. If someone or something is being disparaged, you will often find a competing interest in the wings.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/disparage
disparate,fundamentally different or distinct in quality or kind,"The trunk of some people's cars may contain items as disparate as old clothes, rotting food, and possibly a missing relative. Disparate things are very different from each other.","Near synonyms are unequal and dissimilar. The adjective disparate is from Latin disparātus, from disparāre ""to separate, divide,"" from the prefix dis- ""apart"" plus parāre ""to prepare."" Disparate in the sense of ""very different"" probably developed by association with the Latin adjective dispar ""unequal, different.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/disparate
disseminate,cause to become widely known,"Disseminate means to spread information, knowledge, opinions widely. Semin- derives from the Latin word for seed; the idea with disseminate is that information travels like seeds sown by a farmer.","Think about a teacher distributing a hand out at the beginning of a class. The dis- of disseminate and distribute come from the same Latin prefix which means ""apart, in a different direction."" But unlike papers distributed in class, information, once spread around in all directions, cannot be pulled back in. Think about false rumors or political smear campaigns and you'll understand that dissemination is usually a one-way process.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/disseminate
dissipate,cause to separate and go in different directions,To dissipate is to disperse or fade away — as a bad smell will dissipate (usually) if you wait long enough.,"Dissipate can also mean “spend or use wastefully.” If you win the lottery, you might suddenly find yourself with a group of new friends encouraging you to dissipate your money (on them). Note that dissipate can be used with or without an object: ""Once you dissipate your wealth, your new group of friends will dissipate without a trace.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/dissipate
dissolution,separation into component parts,The dissolution of a relationship means that it's broken up or ended. The dissolution of your band means you better get started on your solo album.,"Dissolution comes from the Latin word dissolutio, meaning ""a dissolving of something."" Dissolution looks very similar to ""dissolve,"" so to help you remember the meaning, think about what happens if you put paper in water — it breaks apart. A dissolution of a marriage is the same thing as divorce. Although it sounds like disillusion, if you try to use them interchangeably, your logic will fall apart.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/dissolution
distend,cause to expand as if by internal pressure,"A soda and pizza binge might make your stomach distend, meaning your stomach will swell as a result of pressure from the inside.","If you’ve ever eaten too much food it won’t surprise you to learn that the verb distend traces back to the Latin words dis-, meaning “apart,” and tendere, meaning “to stretch.” Your stomach will certainly feel stretched out if you do something — like overeat — that causes it to distend. The word distend often applies to stomachs — a pregnancy would also cause a stomach to distend — but it can also refer to anything that is stretched out as a result of internal pressure.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/distend
distinguish,mark as different,"To distinguish means to tell apart. If you win the lottery, you’re going to need to learn to distinguish between people who really like you and people who like your money.","To distinguish is to discern, which means to perceive or recognize the way something differs from what’s around it. It takes discerning taste buds to distinguish between Coke and Pepsi. Distinguish also means to separate yourself out from the pack, usually in a good way. You might distinguish yourself at a Comics Convention with your encyclopedic knowledge of Krazy Kat.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/distinguish
docile,easily handled or managed,"If someone is docile, he is easily taught or handled. If you suddenly became a trouble-maker in class, your teachers would long for the days when you were sweet and docile.","Docile comes from Latin root for teaching, docere, so someone docile is easy to teach. A docile student is willing to be taught. A docile animal is easy to handle. If you behave well and do what people tell you to do, you're a docile person. Docile might be a word of praise, but it can also be a criticism of someone for being overly submissive. Some synonyms are amenable and compliant.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/docile
doctrinaire,a stubborn person of arbitrary or arrogant opinions,You've doubtless met someone doctrinaire at some point. You know them by their complete unwillingness to accept any belief other than their own.,"If you're familiar with the noun ""doctrine"" — a formal idea or system of belief — you'll have no problem with the adjective doctrinaire. It's a just a way of describing a person or group of people who are set in their ways. Parents can start out doctrinaire, but children soon force them to be flexible in how they bring them up.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/doctrinaire
dogmatic,pertaining to a code of beliefs accepted as authoritative,"To be dogmatic is to follow a set of rules no matter what. The rules might be religious, philosophical, or made-up, but dogmatic people would never waver in their beliefs so don’t even think of trying to change their minds.","Dogmatic goes back to the Greek words dogma, which means basically “what one thinks is true” and dogmatikos, “pertaining to doctrine.” To be dogmatic is to follow a doctrine relating to morals and faith, a set of beliefs that is passed down and never questioned. It also refers to arrogant opinions based on unproven theories or even despite facts. Someone dogmatic might insist that dinosaurs never existed or that women shouldn’t drive. Dogmatic people are usually not very popular.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/dogmatic
domestic,of or relating to the home,"Domestic generally means relating to someone's family, home, or home country.

Domestic derives from Middle English, from Old French domestique, from Latin domesticus, from domus, ""house.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/domestic
dormant,inactive but capable of becoming active,"That old dog was dormant for so long he was confused for a furry doormat, but a doormat is likely to stay dormant, or inactive, because it is lifeless: that old dog has some life in him yet.","Volcanoes are described as dormant when they stay cool for a long time, without spewing hot lava and ash. They may have the ability to come to life, but they remain dormant, or inactive. Dormant comes from French dormir, ""to sleep,"" and it refers to living things that are on a break rather than things that have died. Being dormant is being temporarily at rest, although sometimes, as with some cancer cells, things become permanently — and thankfully — dormant.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/dormant
dubious,fraught with uncertainty or doubt,"Choose the adjective dubious for something you have doubts about or you suspect is not true. That bridge you just ""bought"" might be of dubious value.","Dubious stems from Latin dubiosus, ""doubtful"" or ""uncertain,"" and contains the Latin root duo in this case meaning ""of two minds."" This is apparent in that dubious generally describes something that appears one way but is truly another. A dubious claim is probably not true, whereas a dubious website or character is of questionable quality. Dubious can also be synonymous with doubtful, as in ""she was dubious about the idea.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/dubious
duplicity,the act of deceiving or acting in bad faith,"Though he said he didn't know anything about the footprints in the new sidewalk, his duplicity, or deceitfulness, was obvious from the cement caking his shoes. His mouth said one thing, his feet said another.","Many words with ""du"" have meanings with ""two"" or ""duo."" Duplicity is from a Latin word meaning ""twofold, having two parts."" Someone who shows duplicity is two-faced — maybe showing one side in public and another in private — or is just a liar, saying something known to be untrue or misleading. A fraud uses duplicity to gain something with false promises, and someone described as ""fake"" might use duplicity just to fit in or be accepted.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/duplicity
ebullient,joyously unrestrained,"More than chipper, more than happy, more than delighted is ebullient — meaning bubbling over with joy and delight.","There are two senses of the word of ebullient.

Watch out for ebullient personalities: they can often be ""over the top"" as well.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ebullient
eccentric,conspicuously or grossly unconventional or unusual,You're most likely to encounter the adjective eccentric in a description of an unusual or quirky person — like a scatterbrained aunt who leaves her life savings to her cat.,"From the Greek ekkentros, ""out of the center,"" this word originally had to do with the orbits of planets that were observed to be slightly out of whack. Eventually it came to describe people who were a little kooky, both as an adjective and as a noun, too: an eccentric is an unconventional, odd person. Think of them as following a slightly different orbit from the rest of society.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/eccentric
eclectic,someone who selects what seems best of various styles,"She listens to hip-hop, Gregorian chant, and folk music from the '60s.

They both have eclectic tastes.","The English word eclectic first appeared in the seventeenth century to describe philosophers who did not belong to a particular school of thought, but instead assembled their doctrines by picking and choosing from a variety of philosophical systems. Today, the word can refer to any assemblage of varied parts.

edify,make understand,"To edify is to help someone understand, whether it is books that edify those who want to learn a new language, or the explanations that hang beside paintings at a museum that edify visitors who aren't familiar with the artist.","If you know that the noun edifice is a synonym for building, you may wonder what the related verb edify has to do with understanding. You can think of something that edifies as the building blocks of what might become a lifelong interest, like an elementary school teacher who edifies the student who becomes an Abraham Lincoln scholar, or an activity you eventually master, like the beginners' lessons that edify new ice skaters.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/edify
efface,remove by or as if by rubbing or erasing,"If something is erased or rubbed out, it has been effaced. Teachers get annoyed to find that someone has effaced the blackboard — even the part clearly marked, ""Do Not Erase!""","You can also efface things that are not physical — like effacing feelings, impressions, or memories.

They'll have to rely on others' opinions to see how well that works.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/efface
effusion,an unrestrained expression of emotion,"An effusion is an explosion of something, usually words, ideas, or emotions. A popular singer might inspire an effusion of cheers from her devoted fans.","Mozart is known for the effusion of notes he could produce at a moment's notice — and all without erasing.

egalitarian,favoring social equality,"An egalitarian is a person who believes in the equality of all people, and an egalitarian society gives everyone equal rights.","This is a word that means something close to equality and has to do with fairness. If you believe that everyone deserves a chance to vote, go to school, get good jobs, and participate in society, then you are an egalitarian.

egocentric,limited to or caring only about yourself and your own needs,"If you are egocentric, the whole world centers on you and you don't pay much attention to other people.

egregious,conspicuously and outrageously bad or reprehensible,"Something that is egregious stands out, but not in a good way — it means ""really bad or offensive."" If you make an egregious error during a championship soccer match, your coach might bench you for the rest of the game.","An egregious error is so bad that it might not be forgivable. Some synonyms are appalling and intolerable. The word has made a 180-degree turn from its original sense in Latin, when it meant ""exceptionally good."" Word historians have speculated that the negative usage was originally meant to be ironic, but it is the only sense that has survived. Be careful not to use it to mean ""outstanding,"" since no one wants to be called egregious.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/egregious
elicit,"call forth, as an emotion, feeling, or response","When you elicit, you're bringing out a response of some sort.

For example, if you emigrate from Canada and go to Italy, you aren't on vacation — you are making Italy your new home.

empirical,derived from experiment and observation rather than theory,"If knowledge is empirical, it's based on observation rather than theory.

It was originally used in medicine for doctors making choices based on observation and experiment rather than theoretical ideas. It's now used for any kind of knowledge that comes from experience. You can meditate all day on the origins of donuts, but until you visit the donut bakery you'll lack empirical knowledge of donut creation.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/empirical

endemic,native to or confined to a certain region,"If you want to underscore just how commonly found and present something is within a particular place, try the word endemic. The saguaro cactus is endemic, or native, to the American southwest — so watch out for its sharp spines when you're hiking in Arizona!","Although endemic meaning ""prevalent"" often describes a plant or disease, it can also refer to something less tangible and more unwanted such as violence or poverty. Many complain of endemic corruption in the local government. Despite its -ic ending, endemic can also be used as a noun to signify a plant or animal that is prevalent in a certain region.

So would a too-long soak in a hot tub. With your parents.","Trace enervate back far enough and you'll discover that it comes from the Latin enervare which means basically “to cut the sinew” or “to cause to be cut from the muscle.” That would certainly weaken someone.

If you call having to paint the house all by yourself an enormity, your friends might take pity on you and show up with brushes and rollers.","Something that's enormous can be good — a huge paycheck! — or bad, such as a tumor. But when it comes to enormity, some word lovers are up in arms. The word originally meant ""a crime,"" so some people think it should only be used to describe wickedness or lack of morals.

It won't surprise you, then, that epigrams are very short poems, sayings, or famous quotations, like Benjamin Franklin's ""Little strokes fell great oaks,"" a memorable reminder to keep working toward big goals or to pay attention to little details, the opposite of an epigram from our era: ""Don't sweat the small stuff.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/epigram
epitome,a standard or typical example,"If you're talking about a typical example of something, call it the epitome. The cartoon character Garfield is the epitome of the fat, lazy, food-obsessed cat.","Coming to us from Greek through Latin, epitome refers to something that is the ultimate representative of its class. Are you the epitome of the hard-working student or do you believe in study in moderation?

equanimity,steadiness of mind under stress,"If you take the news of your parakeet's death with equanimity, it means you take it calmly without breaking down. Equanimity refers to emotional calmness and balance in times of stress.","If equanimity reminds you of equal, that's because the words have a lot in common. The noun equanimity was borrowed from Latin aequanimitās, from aequanimus ""even-tempered, fair,"" formed from aequus ""even, level, equal"" plus animus ""mind."" The archaic phrase to bear with equal mind means ""to bear with a calm mind,"" and is a translation from the Latin. The phrase a level mind also refers to calmness. A near synonym is composure.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/equanimity
equitable,fair to all parties as dictated by reason and conscience,"Equitable distribution means everyone gets their fair share of something.If you work on a group project in class, you want an equitable share of the credit.","When you look at equitable, you might think you see the word, equal, but it doesn't mean fair in the sense of exactly the same. If you worked ten hours at a lemonade stand and your friend worked five, you'd want an equitable share of the profits rather than an equal share. Equitable would take into account the amount of work you did, equal would not.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/equitable
equivocal,open to two or more interpretations,"Equivocal means uncertain or ambiguous. If you ask your teacher what's on an upcoming test and she gives you an equivocal answer, you won't be able to narrow down your studying.","Equivocal is from the Latin aequus ""equal, the same"" + vocare ""to call, to speak"" and describes when something is too close to call. An editorial in your local newspaper might make a strong case for new taxes on soda, while another editorial is more equivocal. The fact that equivocal means ""uncertain"" and unequivocal means ""certain"" is tricky, and a lot of people get stumped.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/equivocal
erudite,having or showing profound knowledge,"If you call someone erudite, that means they show great learning. After you've earned your second Ph.D., you will be truly erudite.","Erudite is from Latin verb erudire, ""to teach,"" which comes from rudis for ""raw, unskilled, ignorant"" (the source of our word rude). If you bring someone out of a raw state, you educate them, so someone who is erudite is very educated indeed (and perhaps a bit of a showoff). You can say either ER-oo-dite or ER-yoo-dite; the second one, being a bit harder to say, can seem a bit more erudite.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/erudite
esoteric,understandable only by an enlightened inner circle,"Pssst... do you know the secret handshake? If you haven't been brought into the inner circle of those with special knowledge, esoteric things will remain a mystery to you.","In the olden days, achieving esoteric knowledge meant getting initiated into the mystical arts, learning secrets unknown to regular folks. Now when a subject is called esoteric it's usually something not so mystical but still hard to penetrate: financial accounting might seem esoteric for people who get easily stumped filling out their tax forms. Americans might find the sport of cricket to be esoteric, but the rules of baseball can be just as impenetrable to outsiders. The infield fly rule? Totally esoteric.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/esoteric
espouse,"choose and follow a theory, idea, policy, etc.","Use the verb espouse to describe the actions of someone who lives according to specific beliefs, such as your friends who espouse environmentalism and as a result walk whenever possible instead of taking the car.","You can see the word spouse in espouse, so you may be wondering what husbands and wives have to do with it. Originally espouse did mean ""to marry,"" but its meaning has evolved to include other long-term commitments as well, such as support for a principle or a cause. Similar to marriage, if you espouse a belief system, the idea is that you've chosen to wed yourself to it.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/espouse
ethereal,characterized by lightness and insubstantiality,"Something ethereal is airy and insubstantial, like a ghostly figure at the top of the stairs. This word can also describe something delicate and light, like a singer’s ethereal voice.","Ethereal comes from the Greek word for ether, which is a drug that makes you feel light headed and, in larger doses, causes you to lose consciousness.

euphemism,an inoffensive expression substituted for an offensive one,"Pardon me, but when a polite term is substituted for a blunt, offensive one, you should call it a euphemism.","Euphemism is from Greek euphemismos, meaning ""good speech,"" and it's a way that we paper over uncomfortable things with more pleasant-sounding words. These days we tend to use euphemisms when talking about anything having to do with elimination of bodily waste: toilet, bathroom, and water closet were all originally euphemisms. The military is also notorious for using euphemisms, like saying ""neutralizing the target"" instead of ""killing someone.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/euphemism
evanescent,tending to vanish like vapor,"A beautiful sunset, a rainbow, a wonderful dream right before your alarm clock goes off — all of these could be described as evanescent, which means “fleeting” or “temporary.”","Evanescent comes from the Latin ex, meaning ""out of,"" and vanescere, meaning ""to vanish."" When pronouncing this word, emphasize the third syllable and note that the c is silent.

exacerbate,make worse,"For a formal-sounding verb that means to make worse, try exacerbate. If you're in trouble, complaining about it will only exacerbate the problem.","Exacerbate is related to the adjective acrid, often used to describe sharp-smelling smoke. Think of exacerbate then as a sharp or bitter thing that makes something worse. A drought will exacerbate a country's food shortage.

exacting,requiring precise accuracy,"Use the adjective exacting to describe something or someone very precise or strict in its requirements. If your teacher has exacting standards about spelling and punctuation, you better carefully check your final paper.","An exacting person expects things to be, well, exact. For this reason, demanding is a good synonym. Friends who are exacting might let you have it if you show up a minute or two late. Some exacting people are extremely selective about what they eat, rejecting anything that doesn't meet their complicated standards of nutrition and taste.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/exacting
exalt,"praise, glorify, or honor","You might like your manager, but if you exalt her, it means you really put her on a pedestal and treat her like royalty.","To exalt is to hold or raise someone up to a high position or status.

When you exhaust something, you use it up entirely, so something exhaustive is complete. After your exhaustive tour of Rome, you're exhausted.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/exhaustive
exhort,spur on or encourage especially by cheers and shouts,"French roots for the word exhort mean ""thoroughly encourage,"" so to exhort is to fill up with encouragement! ""When he heard the crowd exhort him with stomping and cheers, he knew that he could finish the marathon.""","Some synonyms for exhort include stimulate, excite, and urge on. Words and shouts can exhort, and this is especially true when the recipient of those chants fears coming up short with an effort.

A sergeant might exhort his troops after a defeat just as a dad can exhort his daughter after a missed note during a piano recital.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/exhort
exigency,a pressing or urgent situation,"Think of a mix of excitement and emergency, and you have exigency, a sudden, urgent crisis. The very word conjures up danger and intrigue that demand a cool head and an immediate effort at a solution.","The meaning of exigency is obvious from its source, the Latin noun exigentia, which means ""urgency"" and comes from the verb exigere, meaning ""to demand or require."" An emergency situation, or exigency, is urgent and demands immediate action.

Each is an exigency — it's all a matter of perspective.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/exigency
existential,relating to or dealing with the state of being,"If something is existential, it has to do with human existence. If you wrestle with big questions involving the meaning of life, you may be having an existential crisis.","Existential can also relate to existence in a more concrete way. For instance, the objections of your mother-in-law may pose an existential threat to the continuation of your Friday night card game. Often the word carries at least a nodding reference to the philosophy of existentialism associated with Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Sartre, and others, which emphasizes the individual as a free agent responsible for his actions.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/existential
exonerate,pronounce not guilty of criminal charges,To exonerate someone is to declare him not guilty of criminal charges. This word is pretty much only used in reference to proceedings in a court of law. A word with a similar meaning that might be familiar is “acquit.”,"When your next door neighbor was arrested for painting smiley faces on the front doors of all the houses on your block, evidence to exonerate him was discovered when the police found a young hooligan from the next street over with a basement full of paint canisters. The verb comes from the Latin exonerat-, meaning “freed from burden.” A criminal charge is certainly a burden, and when you're exonerated, you're freed from that burden.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/exonerate
expatriate,a person who is voluntarily absent from home or country,"An expatriate is someone who lives in another country by choice. If you leave your split-level ranch in Ohio and move to a writers' commune in Paris for good, you've become an expatriate.","Expatriate can also be a verb, so that American in Paris has expatriated. There was a scene of expatriates, or expats, living in Paris in the roaring '20s that included writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein. The word used to mean to get kicked out of your native country — it's from the French word expatrier which means ""banish.""

expedite,process fast and efficiently,"To expedite something is to make it go faster or speed up the process. Expediting that package might get it to Alaska by tomorrow, instead of next Tuesday.","If someone says, ""Let me expedite the process,"" that's probably a good thing: they're offering to speed things up. If you've ever waited in line a long time, then you must have wished someone could expedite things. A driver can expedite his commute by going in the faster car-pool lane.

extol,"praise, glorify, or honor","If you have a crush on a guy who likes your best friend, it can be very depressing to listen to him extol your friend's virtues, while you just nod and smile. If you extol something, you praise it very highly.","The Bible says: ""Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven..."" Nebuchadnezzar II was king of the second Babylonian Empire, the one who sent the Jews into exile. In some translations of the Bible, the word honor is replaced with glorify. Praise, extol, honor, glorify all mean about the same. The Bible often uses five words when one would be enough.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/extol
extraneous,not belonging to that in which it is contained,"Extraneous means coming from the outside, like the extraneous noise you hear when you're in a theater and a train passes by. Extraneous can also mean not relevant or essential, like all the extraneous information in your long-winded science report.","In Latin, extra means outside, as in extraordinary ""outside the ordinary,"" or extraterrestrial 'coming from outside earth.'

extrapolate,draw from specific cases for more general cases,"When you extrapolate, you use specific details to make a general conclusion. For example, if you travel to Canada and encounter only friendly, kind natives, you might extrapolate that all Canadians are friendly.","The verb extrapolate can mean ""to predict future outcomes based on known facts.""

extrovert,a person directed toward others as opposed to the self,"An extrovert is a friendly person who enjoys talking to and being with other people. Extroverts love parties, talking on the phone, and meeting new people.","This noun has a specialized sense in psychology, and its opposite is introvert..

fabrication,the act of making a product from raw materials,"A fabrication is something made up, like a lie. Telling your boss that the subway broke down when in fact you just forgot to set your alarm is a fabrication.","The word fabrication was originally used to talk about manufacturing or construction, and it referred to the act of assembling something. Tires and steering wheels are necessary materials for automobile fabrication. Nowadays, the word fabrication is usually used to refer to the act of coming up with a story out of thin air.

facetious,cleverly amusing in tone,"Don’t take a facetious comment seriously because it’s supposed to be funny. Anything facetious is a joke. If you've just won a hotdog-eating contest and someone asks if you'd like to go out for burgers, they’re probably being facetious.","If you forget how to spell facetious, notice that it has all five vowels in a row. The word facetious comes from the French facétie, “joke,” and it has come to describe a joke with a little drop of sarcasm. It used to simply mean “funny and witty,” but now it often implies that someone is being inappropriately funny about a serious topic.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/facetious
facile,arrived at without due care or effort; lacking depth,"If someone does something easily, or shows ease, it is described as facile in a good way, but if someone takes the easy way out and shows a lack of thought or care, it is facile in a bad way.","While it is a lovely sounding French word, facile is both a compliment and an insult depending on how it's used. Something that shows ready skill is facile, such as being facile with text messaging. But if something is too simple and superficial, or shows little care, it can also be called facile.

faction,a dissenting clique,"Fractions are smaller parts of whole numbers: one-quarter, one-tenth, one-half, and a faction is a smaller portion of a larger group that breaks away from it. A faction might take a fraction of the people from a large group and start a new group.","The Latin source of the word faction means to ""do"" or ""make,"" though a faction can seem to be a taking away or un-doing. Politics is one area where faction gets a lot of use, because a political party often starts with a large group but has some members who disagree with a belief or direction.

farcical,broadly or extravagantly humorous,"Something that's farcical is ridiculously funny — absurd, even.

Farcical comes from the Latin farcire, ""to stuff,"" which influenced the French farce, a ""comic interlude in a mystery play.""

fastidious,giving careful attention to detail,"If you want to describe a person who insists on perfection or pays much attention to food, clothing and cleanliness, the right word is fastidious.","Fastidious is a funny-sounding adjective from the Latin fastidium ""loathing"" that has several equally strange-sounding synonyms — persnickety, fussbudgety, finicky and punctilious.

fatalist,someone who feels powerless to change his or her destiny,"A fatalist is someone who feels that no matter what he or she does, the outcome will be the same because it's predetermined.

The Latin root is fatalis, ""ordained by fate or destined.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/fatalist
fatuous,devoid of intelligence,"Fatuous means lacking intelligence. When your mother outlaws calling your brother stupid, use fatuous instead.","Fatuous derives from the Latin fatuus meaning ""foolish."" It sounds like it should have something to do with being fat, but it actually has no relation to size. Fatuus itself comes from a root that also gave us ""debate"" and this might be a good way to remember it. You want to debate someone who's fatuous, because they are unintelligent, silly and even a bit conceited, so they probably won't be very persuasive debaters. Just don't call them fatuous to their face. Even if they don't know what it means, it's just not nice!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/fatuous
fauna,all the animal life in a particular region or period,"When you go on a nature walk in a school setting, your teacher might tell you to observe the flora and fauna in the woods. Flora is plant life; fauna refers to animals.","Fauna derives from the name of a Roman goddess, but the handiest way to remember the difference between flora and fauna is that flora sounds like flowers, which are part of the plant world; fauna, however, sounds like ""fawn,"" and fawns are part of the animal kingdom.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/fauna
fecund,capable of producing offspring or vegetation,"The adjective fecund describes things that are highly fertile and that easily produce offspring or fruit. Rabbits are often considered to be fecund animals, and you may hear jokes in poor taste about people reproducing like rabbits if they have a lot of children.","The word fecund comes from the Latin word fecundus, meaning fruitful. But the English word does not just describe something or someone fertile, the adjective fecund can also be used to describe someone who is innovative or highly intellectually productive. Your fecund imagination will be an asset if you have to tell ghost stories around the fire at camp while eating s'mores but that same fecund imagination could be less helpful if you're at home alone on a stormy night and you think you hear a knock at the door!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/fecund
felicity,state of well-being characterized by contentment,"Felicity is a state of happiness or the quality of joy. Sitting on the roof with a telescope and iced tea on a clear, starry night is one way to find perfect felicity — a happy place.","Felicity comes from the Latin fēlīcitās, meaning ""happiness.""

fervor,feelings of great warmth and intensity,"Use fervor to describe an intensity of emotion or expression.

A corresponding adjective is fervent; synonyms of the noun and adjective are ardor and ardent.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/fervor
fetter,restrain with shackles,"A fetter is a shackle or chain that is attached to someone’s ankles. To fetter someone is to restrict their movement, either literally or metaphorically.

To fetter, the verb, could be used literally: the prison wardens would fetter the chain gangs who built many of the railroads in the US., but it usually means something has been done to restrain someone’s behavior: ""we finally managed to fetter our sons’ computer use with bribery.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/fetter
fidelity,the quality of being faithful,Fidelity is the quality of being faithful or loyal. Dogs are famous for their fidelity.,"Fidelity comes from the Latin root fides, which means faith, so fidelity is the state of being faithful. Marital fidelity is faithfulness to your spouse. If you're a journalist, your reports should have fidelity to the facts. Someone without fidelity to a religion or group belief is called an infidel.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/fidelity
figurative,not literal,"When speech or writing is not literal, it is figurative, like when you say you have a ton of homework. You don't really have 2000 pounds of homework, do you? Also, when art depicts a figure from life it is figurative, like a figurative drawing of a dancer.","The adjective figurative comes from the Old French word figuratif, which means “metaphorical.” Any figure of speech — a statement or phrase not intended to be understood literally — is figurative. You say your hands are frozen, or you are so hungry you could eat a horse. That's being figurative. In art, figure means ""human or animal form,"" so a figurative drawing might show horses running across a field.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/figurative
finesse,subtly skillful handling of a situation,"Having finesse means you can handle difficult situations with diplomacy and tact, like the finesse it takes to help two friends work out their differences — without taking sides or alienating either one.",Finesse is having grace under pressure. It's handling the rantings of an angry customer with a smile and a calm tone. Someone who has finesse says the right thing at the right time — or knows when to say nothing at all. Finesse looks like fineness and in fact comes from the Middle French word that means exactly that — delicate in nature. People with finesse can handle anything — with a delicate approach that really works.,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/finesse
flagrant,conspicuously and outrageously bad or reprehensible,"Something flagrant is bad — so bad you can't ignore it. A flagrant foul in sports might send you to the bench, and a flagrant violation of the law might send you to the slammer.","The current meaning of the adjective flagrant — ""obviously offensive or disgraceful"" — is thought to derive from the Latin legal term in flagrante delicto, which literally meant ""with fire still blazing"" and is used figuratively to describe a situation in which the criminal is caught red handed. Aside from a flagrant abuse of the law, the word can also be used to describe anything that is obviously bad — like flagrant bad taste or flagrant abuse of the rules of grammar.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/flagrant
flaunt,display proudly,"Flaunt is ""to display proudly or show off,"" like when you flaunt your new Italian leather jacket by wearing it to the beach and pretending you're cold to make sure everyone sees it.","Although we love it when a peacock flaunts his colorful feathers, when a person does the same thing we feel bad. Flaunt is like bragging, which can bum people out because they don't have whatever you're showing off, like that cool jacket. When rich people flaunt their wealth by speeding past you in their limo, they may as well splash a mud puddle on your white clothes. Leave the flaunting for peacocks and stars in bad reality TV shows.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/flaunt
flout,treat with contemptuous disregard,"To flout is to scorn or show contempt for. ""I flout the law and the concept of civilian safety by making a concerted effort to jaywalk every time I cross a street.""","Oddly enough, when flout came into existence in the 1550s, it had a much different sense to it than it does now; it's believed that it evolved from the Middle English flowten, “to play the flute."" These days, the verb flout means ""to scorn,"" as in to scorn a law, person, or social norm by defying it. As a noun, it is a contemptuous remark or insult.

foible,a minor weakness or peculiarity in someone's character,"If you repeat foible out loud enough times, it sounds so funny that you can laugh at it and maybe remember to laugh at the odd and distinctive weaknesses of others — the foible or two or a hundred that we all have.","Sometimes a foible helps make a person who they are, even if the foible, or weakness (""feeble"" is a close relative), is a little odd. Synonyms for foible in a negative sense are ""failing,"" ""shortcoming,"" and in a more positive sense ""quirk,"" ""eccentricity."" It can likewise be annoying or endearing. Most people have a foible, or idiosyncrasy, that stands out to others, but interestingly, a person rarely sees his or her own characteristic foible.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/foible
foment,try to stir up,"Stand outside the school cafeteria passing out flyers with nutritional details on school food, and you may foment a revolution — foment means stirring up something undesirable, such as trouble.","You would never say, ""Hooray, we fomented a revolution."" Instead you'd say, ""Those good for nothing scalawags fomented the rebellion."" Don't confuse foment and ferment. Ferment can mean ""to stir up"" in a good way — a football game can ferment excitement in a town, or foment trouble through traffic tie-ups and litter.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/foment
forbear,refrain from doing,"When you forbear, you hold yourself back from doing something. If you're mad at your best friend, you might forbear to return her text messages for a while.","If you forbear to giggle during your teacher's stern lecture, that's a good thing. You keep yourself from laughing out loud, even though that's instinctively what you want to do. The Old English root, forberan, means ""control one's feelings, or tolerate."" A less common way to use forbear is as a noun meaning ""ancestor."" So if you're refraining from reading about your ancestors, you can say you forbear to learn about your forbears.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/forbear
forego,do without or cease to hold or adhere to,"If you forego something, you choose to give it up. If you forego dessert after dinner, you are skipping dessert.","The verb forego (also spelled forgo) literally means “to go by.” In common usage it means “to abstain” or “do without.” You might forego smoking cigarettes as a New Year’s resolution. Forego can also mean “to precede,” or “go before.” This verb is often seen in its past participle form, foregone, in the phrase “foregone conclusion,” meaning a predetermined conclusion.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/forego
forsake,leave someone who needs or counts on you; leave in the lurch,"To forsake another person is to leave them entirely, usually in a moment of need.","Forsake may mean simply giving something up, such as a way of life or a homeland, for something better or more appropriate. But it is often a mean word, suggesting leaving something or someone behind when they need you to stay. One way to remember the meaning of this verb — to abandon or desert — is to remember this little sentence: ""For heaven's sake, don't leave me, or heaven is lost!"" Lose the heaven, and you have forsake.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/forsake
fortuitous,lucky; occurring by happy chance,"Fortuitous means by chance, like a lucky accident. If you and your best friend's families happen to go on vacation to the same place at the same time, that’s a fortuitous coincidence!","Something fortuitous is random like an accident, but there’s no downside. A rock falling on your head is an accident, dollar bills falling on your head is fortuitous. The meaning of fortuitous is changing from ""happening by chance"" to ""lucky chance"" because people get it mixed up with fortunate. But watch out: If you say fortuitous to mean just plain lucky without the element of chance –– that's a usage error.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/fortuitous
founder,fail utterly; collapse,"The person who creates an organization or a company is known as the founder. Founder is also a verb meaning ""fail miserably,"" which is something a company's founder hopes the company will never do.","As a noun, founder means ""the beginner or originator of something."" You might talk about the founder of a nation, the founder of club, or the founder of a website. As a verb, founder can mean “stumble,” like when you trip and fall, but more generally it means ""collapse or fall apart."" A sports team might founder by slumping on a ten-game losing streak; a ship that sinks in a bad storm can be said to have foundered at sea.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/founder
fraternal,like or characteristic of or befitting a brother,"Use the adjective fraternal to mean ""brotherly,"" the way you'd describe your fraternal relationship with your oldest friend who is like a brother to you.","A fight between brothers? You could chalk it up to fraternal rivalry. Fraternal describes the relationship between brothers, but it is also used is to describe a club, society or fraternity, some brotherly group of people — usually men — with common interests. Fraternal twins, unlike identical twins, are formed from separate ova. That's why they don't look exactly alike and can be a girl and a boy, instead of two girls or two boys.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/fraternal
frenetic,excessively agitated,"The adjective frenetic is another way to say frenzied, frantic, or totally worked up. Kind of how you'd run around the kitchen madly trying to cook a last-minute dinner for 30 of your closest friends.","Sometimes tinged with fear and often quite maniacal, frenetic comes from the Latin phreneticus, meaning “delirious.” The Latin word, in turn, came from a similarly spelled Greek word which, when translated literally, means “inflammation of the brain.” So it's no surprise that a frenetic person looks absolutely crazed and super anxious.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/frenetic
frugal,avoiding waste,A person who lives simply and economically can be called frugal. Buying clothes at a consignment shop would be considered frugal. Not getting your mom a gift for her birthday — that's just cheap.,"Thrifty, spartan, and prudent are synonyms for frugal, a word that often has positive connotations when used to describe a person who lives a simple life. ""The question for retailers is whether shoppers will remain frugal or slowly resume their old spending habits whenever they get more money in their pockets,"" wrote The Wall Street Journal. You might also speak of ""a frugal meal"" — a very plain, cheap one. The word is from Latin frux, meaning ""fruit"" (in the sense of ""profit"").",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/frugal
furtive,secret and sly or sordid,"If you're looking for a formal adjective to describe something sly or secret, sneak in furtive. Let's hope the teacher doesn't see your furtive attempts to pass notes in class!","The adjective, furtive, is related to fūrtum, the Latin word for theft or robbery. This is apparent as the expressions ""to give someone a furtive glance"" and ""to steal a glance at someone"" mean the same thing. If a person's manner is furtive, he or she is acting suspiciously. Secret, stealthy and sly are all similar in meaning, but they lack this image of a thief's actions.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/furtive
futile,unproductive of success,"When something fails to deliver a useful result, you can call it futile. Hopefully all the time you're spending studying vocabulary won't turn out to be futile!","Futile comes from the Latin futilis, which originally meant ""leaky."" Although we use futile to talk about more than buckets, the image of a leaky vessel is a good illustration of the adjective. Pouring water into a leaky bucket is futile. Your exercise program will be futile if you don't stop chowing down on chocolate. Futile is fancier than its synonym useless. Other synonyms are fruitless or vain. The i can be either short (FYOO-t'l) or long (FYOO-tile).",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/futile
garrulous,full of trivial conversation,"A garrulous person just won’t stop talking (and talking, and talking, and talking...).","Garrulous comes from the Latin word garrire for ""chattering or prattling."" If someone is garrulous, he doesn't just like to talk; he indulges in talking for talking’s sake — whether or not there’s a real conversation going on. If you discover that you have a garrulous neighbor sitting next to you on the plane, you might just want to feign sleep, unless you really want to hear everything going through his mind for the entire trip.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/garrulous
gauche,lacking social polish,"Use the word gauche when you want to call something tacky, graceless, tactless, rude, boorish, or awkward and foolish. Have you just pointed out someone's misuse of this word? Oh dear, how gauche!","Gauche was used for a long time to refer to things that were just so wrong, it almost hurt to talk about them, like publicly asking someone why they don’t like you. That is so gauche, it could induce a cringe! Gauche is almost a gauche word, as it is comes from a French word meaning left (as opposed to right). It would be gauche to call left-handed people tacky!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/gauche
genre,a kind of literary or artistic work,"A genre is a specific type of music, film, or writing. Your favorite literary genre might be science fiction, and your favorite film genre might be horror flicks about cheerleaders. Go figure.","In music, genre refers to musical style such as jazz, salsa or rock. In film or literature, the genre is determined by the subject, setting or plot of the story. When you are wandering around a book store, books are usually arranged by genre. Many genres, such as ""mystery"" or ""fantasy,"" overlap in film and literature, while others, such as ""romantic comedy"" in film or ""historical fiction"" in books, are specific to one or the other.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/genre
genteel,marked by refinement in taste and manners,"Although the adjective genteel means high-class and refined, it is often used today in a somewhat mocking tone, as though good manners and elegance are passé. Still, it would be nice if more people were a little more genteel.","The word genteel comes from the Old French word gentil, ""high-born, noble."" We can see the similarity to the word gentle, as in gentleman and gentlewoman. The word is especially powerful in describing Chaucer's Knight in the Canterbury Tales as ""a verray, parfit gentil knyght"" — ""a true, perfect, noble knight,"" dignified, patrician, and as genteel as they come. Today, it describes someone elegant, fashionable, and well-bred. Picture someone in riding jodhpurs reading ""Town and Country"" while astride a magnificent show horse.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/genteel
gesticulate,"show, express, or direct through movement","When you gesticulate, you make sweeping and excited movements with your hands when speaking. Someone describing a scary car accident might gesticulate wildly.","The verb gesticulate is related to the noun gesture. Gesture has stress on the first syllable, and gesticulate has the stress on the second syllable. Gesticulate, which comes from the Latin gesticulus meaning ""to mimic,"" describes animated movements people make in conversation — with and without words. People who gesticulate could be said to talk with their hands!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/gesticulate
glut,supply with an excess of,"A glut is too much of something. A glut of gas in the marketplace can lower its price. A glut of heavy metal T-shirts in your dresser, however, has nothing to do with the economy but might be a signal that it's time to clean your room.","Glut comes from the Old French gloter, meaning ""to swallow too much."" The glottis is the part of your body where your vocal folds reside and where you swallow. If you go to the movies alone and get the family tub of popcorn, you are glutting yourself on the salty snack, but do try not to get any popcorn stuck in your glottis. Glut is used more commonly in reference to the economics of the marketplace, where an oversupply of one thing lowers prices.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/glut
grandiloquent,puffed up with vanity,"Grandiloquent is a fancy term for, well, being fancy or pretentious. In fact, you might say grandiloquent is itself a pretty grandiloquent word.","The word grandiloquent generally refers to the way a person behaves or speaks. Politicians and schoolteachers are the usual suspects of this manner of behavior, known as grandiloquence, but it can refer to anything that's overbearing or pompous in style or manner. Architecture, especially, is highly guilty of being grandiloquent — if you check out just about anything built in the Baroque style, you could describe it as grandiloquent.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/grandiloquent
grandiose,impressive because of unnecessary largeness or magnificence,"You've got big plans. Huge plans. Whatever it is, it's going to blow minds and absolutely rock worlds! Well, to some people those plans might sound a bit grandiose, or unnecessarily overblown and even highfalutin.","Coming from the Italian word grandioso (meaning ""grand"" or ""noble""), the adjective grandiose is kind of like Italian hand gestures: big, exaggerated, and over the top. And it's that excessiveness that pushes something grand (large, with an air of distinction) into grandiose (large, but trying too hard) territory.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/grandiose
gratuitous,unnecessary and unwarranted,"Gratuitous means ""without cause"" or ""unnecessary."" Telling ridiculous jokes at a somber occasion would be a display of gratuitous humor.","Gratuitous can be used to refer to something that’s unnecessary and mildly annoying. If a friend frequently gives you fashion tips, even though you’ve expressed no interest in receiving them, you’d be correct in labeling her advice as gratuitous. In addition, gratuitous can be used to indicate that something is not only unnecessary but also inappropriate. Some people claim that some films and video games contain gratuitous violence — that is, violence that is excessive and offensive.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/gratuitous
gravity,a manner that is serious and solemn,"In physics, gravity is the natural force that causes things to fall toward the earth. The noun gravity can also mean seriousness or solemnity.","Someone who conducts themselves with an air of gravity is someone who takes what they are doing seriously. You might be amused to see a three year old serving her dolls tea with an air of gravity appropriate to the Queen of England. Gravity was borrowed through French from Latin gravitās, from gravis ""heavy.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/gravity
gregarious,temperamentally seeking and enjoying the company of others,"If you know someone who's outgoing, sociable, and fond of the company of others, you might want to call her gregarious.","The word was originally used to describe animals that live in flocks — it's from the Latin word grex, meaning ""herd."" Not surprisingly, people began using it to describe humans who liked being in groups. Today biologists still speak of gregarious species, but you're more likely to hear it in reference to people. Despite what you might suspect, it has no historical connection to the name Gregory — but if you know an outgoing fellow with that name, you could call him Greg-arious.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/gregarious
guile,shrewdness as demonstrated by being skilled in deception,"Use the noun guile for cunning, craftiness, and artful duplicity. Acting like you have a job on Wall Street when you're actually unemployed would take a lot of guile.","The noun guile has quite negative connotations, as it refers to the kind of knowledge and skill that can be used by comic book villains for evil and not good! People who have guile are also thought of as being wily (which is also a related word), sneaky, and deceitful. Those who are free of guile are pure and upstanding, and Henry David Thoreau affirms those feelings when he writes: ""It is the work of a brave man surely, in whom there was no guile!""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/guile
hackneyed,repeated too often; overfamiliar through overuse,"Hackneyed is a word for language that doesn't pack a punch since it's overused and trite. ""Roses are red, violets are..."" — enough already?! That's hackneyed stuff.","Hackneyed is usually used to describe tired writing, but you can also refer to the hackneyed plots of television sit-coms or the hackneyed jokes of your Uncle Fred. But, most often, you will see hackneyed before the word phrase to refer to a specific cliché that is annoying the heck out of someone.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/hackneyed
hapless,unfortunate and deserving pity,"Use the adjective hapless to describe someone unlucky and deserving of pity, like the hapless car buyer who gives in to the fast-talking salesperson.","The word hapless traces all the way back to the Old Norse word happ, meaning “chance, good luck.” Combine this with the suffix -less (“lacking”) and hapless means “unlucky” or “ill-fated.” A traveler who goes to Moscow and briefly gets lost on the subway? Just a tourist. A traveler who goes to Moscow, accidentally eats food he is allergic to, somehow loses all his money, and by chance gets on a train destined for Mongolia? Definitely hapless.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/hapless
harbinger,something indicating the approach of something or someone,A harbinger is something that comes before and that shows what will follow in the future. The robin is a harbinger of spring — its presence means spring is coming soon.,"The appearance of a ghost is often thought of as a harbinger of death. Middle English herbergere is from Old French herbergeor, ""host,"" from herberge, ""camp, shelter,"" a word ultimately borrowed from a Germanic language.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/harbinger
hedonism,an ethical system that values the pursuit of pleasure,"Strictly speaking, hedonism is the belief that pursuing pleasure leads to the greatest ethical good. In practice, though, the ethical part sometimes gets lost in the pleasure part.","Hedonism originally hails from the Greek word hedone, meaning ""pleasure."" In Ancient Greece, hedonism really did have an ethical component, and its adherents really believed that society would be best served if you as an individual cultivated those things that gave you the greatest pleasure, instead of the self-denial inherent in other philosophies and religions. Over time the philosophical aspect of hedonism has faded and we are left an idea that looks to us very much like, well, Las Vegas.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/hedonism
hegemony,the dominance or leadership of one social group over others,Hegemony is political or cultural dominance or authority over others. The hegemony of the popular kids over the other students means that they determine what is and is not cool.,"Hegemony comes from the Greek hegemon ""leader."" Wealthy lender nations hoping to determine political outcomes and trade decisions have established hegemony over the debtor nations they lend to. As well as the dominance of one group or nation over others, hegemony is also the term for the leading group or nation itself. During the American Revolution, colonists fought to throw off the British hegemony.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/hegemony
heresy,a belief that rejects the orthodox tenets of a religion,A heresy is a belief that doesn't agree with the official tenets of a particular religion; heresy is the maintaining of such contrary beliefs.,"Heresy can be used figuratively: to disagree with the school committee's decisions is considered pure heresy by the faculty. You'll often come across this word in a religious context — the Latin root haeresis, ""school of thought or sect,"" was used by Christian writers to mean ""unorthodox sect or belief."" This comes from the Greek hairesis, ""a taking or choosing,"" from hairein, ""to choose."" A person who chooses to believe in heresies is called a heretic.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/heresy
hermetic,completely sealed or airtight,"If you want to keep cookies crisp for a long time, store them in a jar with a hermetic, or airtight, seal. Hermetic means sealed so that no air can get in.","The word can be used metaphorically as well. A child who is completely protected from the outside world might be said to come from a hermetic environment. The word comes from the name of the Greek god, Hermes Trismegistus, who was a magician and alchemist and was credited with creating the process for making a completely airtight glass tube, a god-like feat if there ever was one.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/hermetic
heyday,the period of greatest prosperity or productivity,"A heyday is a peak of popularity or success. If you hear someone say ""Hey! Back in the day, I was the best boxer in the city! No one could beat me!"" he might be remembering his heyday as a fighter.","If you remember a time in the past when you were doing something really well or getting a lot of attention or fame, you might be reminiscing about your heyday. A person or an organization — and even a thing — can have a heyday, or a peak time when everything goes well. The good news is that a heyday can come again and again, so while your heyday as student president might be just a memory, there might be a heyday as governor of your state years later.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/heyday
hiatus,an interruption in the intensity or amount of something,"A temporary gap, pause, break, or absence can be called a hiatus. When your favorite TV show is on hiatus, that means there are no new episodes — not forever, just for a little while.","Even things that go on for a long time take a break once in a while: one kind of break is a hiatus. If someone has to leave her job for a time, she's going on hiatus. A touring band will need to take a hiatus if the lead singer gets in an accident. The key thing about a hiatus is that it's an interruption of something that was happening, but it's not a permanent break.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/hiatus
hierarchy,a series of ordered groupings within a system,"Hierarchy describes a system that organizes or ranks things, often according to power or importance. At school the principal is at the top of the staff hierarchy, while the seniors rule the student hierarchy.","Also known as a pecking order or power structure, a hierarchy is a formalized or simply implied understanding of who's on top or what's most important. All that sorting and ranking can be helpful if you're a business administrator, but if you find yourself arranging all the produce in your fridge according to a hierarchy of color, size, and expiration date, you might want to consider visiting a therapist.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/hierarchy
histrionic,characteristic of acting or a stage performance,"Anything that has to do with actors or acting can be called histrionic, like a Broadway actor's histrionic voice projection that would sound strange in everyday life but is perfect for the stage.","The adjective histrionic, pronounced ""his-tree-ON-ic,"" comes from the Latin words histrionicus and histrio which mean “actor.” It can describe things that have to do with acting on the stage, but it can also describe a person who in regular life is a little too dramatic and even over-acts, like your friend whose histrionic rantings make a trip to the grocery store seem like a matter of life and death.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/histrionic
homily,a sermon on a moral or religious topic,"A homily is a sermon or religious speech offering encouragement or moral correction. Isn’t it strange how sometimes, when you're struggling with something, a preacher comes on TV giving a homily on that same problem?! Too bad it happens when you do bad stuff, too.","In many churches and lecture halls, a homily is just a short message on a religious topic or moral issue that's meant to encourage those who hear it. Another type of homily, though, is one that's judgmental or condemning. If you hear a homily and feel better afterward, even if it delivers hard truths about right and wrong, you've heard an uplifting homily. One that leaves you mad and frustrated, however, might make you need another homily on forgiveness and self-control.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/homily
homogeneous,all of the same or similar kind or nature,"If a group of things are homogeneous, they're all the same or similar, like a room full of identically dressed Elvis impersonators.","The adjective homogeneous comes from the Greek homogenes, meaning “of the same kind.” You can break down the root of the word further into two parts: homos, meaning “same,” and genos, meaning “kind, gender, race, stock.” It sounds very scientific, but if you look around the table at home and everyone is eating a bowl of oatmeal, you could safely describe your family’s breakfast tastes as homogeneous.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/homogeneous
husbandry,the practice of cultivating the land or raising stock,"Husbandry has nothing to do with being a husband, and a lot to do with being a farmer. If you cultivate the land or breed animals, you are practicing husbandry.","Long before husbands were hen-pecked guys who cut the grass on weekends and played with the kiddies after school, they were robust men of the Earth — farmers, in other words. That meaning died out, but its current meaning survives as a remnant of it. Today, you most often hear of ""crop husbandry"", which refers to raising crops; however, if you practice toad husbandry — you must be raising toads.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/husbandry
hyperbole,extravagant exaggeration,"Praising your favorite sports team is one thing, but if you call the team the most incredible group of humans ever to walk the earth, then you're going overboard and indulging in hyperbole.","The hyper- in hyperbole means ""beyond,"" so it's a good sign that the word has to do with going above and beyond what's necessary. Someone who gets hyperactive about something and ends up hyperventilating (breathing too hard) might be prone to the exaggerated style of speaking known as hyperbole. If you find yourself talking about the absolutely best (or worst) thing of all time, it's time to take it down a notch and cut down on the hyperbole.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/hyperbole
hypothetical,a conjectural possibility or circumstance,"Everyone who has ever taken a science class knows the word ""hypothesis,"" which means an idea, or a guess, that you are going to test through an experiment. A hypothetical is related to that. It means something based on an informed guess.",Hypotheticals are fun. How would you do in a hypothetical arm-wrestling competition against your Grandma?

What if France developed the ability to pelt Switzerland with cannons firing cheeses?,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/hypothetical
iconoclast,someone who attacks cherished ideas or institutions,Are you always challenging the establishment? Or provoking popular thought by attacking traditions and institutions? Then you're definitely an iconoclast.,"To be called an iconoclast today is usually kind of cool — they're rugged individualists, bold thinkers who don't give a hoot what tradition calls for. But back in medieval Greece, the iconoclasts had a more thuggish reputation. Stemming from the Greek words eikon, meaning ""image,"" and klastes, meaning ""breaker,"" an iconoclast was someone who destroyed religious sculptures and paintings.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/iconoclast
ideology,an orientation that characterizes the thinking of a group,An ideology is a set of opinions or beliefs of a group or an individual. Very often ideology refers to a set of political beliefs or a set of ideas that characterize a particular culture.,"Capitalism, communism, socialism, and Marxism are ideologies. But not all -ism words are. Think: cronyism (a system of graft whereby friends unfairly help each other make money.) Our English noun is from French idéologie. The suffix –logy, used with many English words describing theories or doctrines, is from Greek logos ""word, reason, speech, account.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ideology
idiosyncrasy,a behavioral attribute peculiar to an individual,"If a person has an idiosyncrasy, he or she has a little quirk, or a funny behavior, that makes him or her different. If you only say goodbye in French, never in English, that would be an idiosyncrasy.","Idio seems like it means stupid, but really it is Latin for ""one's own,"" as an idiosyncrasy is one's own particular, usually odd, behavior. Putting salt in your hot chocolate or needing the light on to sleep or tapping your head while you think are all idiosyncrasies. A machine such as a DVD player has an idiosyncrasy if you have to do something weird to it to make it work like having to bang it on the back left-hand side to stop it from skipping.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/idiosyncrasy
idyllic,charmingly simple and serene,A week at the beach that goes perfectly is an idyllic vacation. Idyllic means so wonderful it seems almost magical.,"Are you having an idyllic childhood? You may not think so now, but in your old age, you may remember your days as a youngster as simple and carefree.

ignominy,a state of dishonor,"If you walk into class in your underwear, you'll know what the word ignominy means. Ignominy is a noun meaning great public shame, disgrace, or embarrassment, or a situation or event that causes this.","The shame can be major or minor: someone can suffer the ignominy of defeat or the ignominies of old age. When pronouncing this word, the main accent is on the first syllable, and the secondary accent is on the third syllable. Ignominy is from Latin the ignominia, formed from the prefix in-, ""no, not,"" plus nomen, ""name."" The implication is that if someone has suffered ignominy, they have lost their good name or reputation.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ignominy
illicit,contrary to accepted morality or convention,"Illicit means not allowed by law or custom. It's illegal to kill endangered elephants, but many poachers still engage in the Illicit ivory trade.","Illicit usually refers to something that is not morally proper or acceptable.

immigrate,come into a new country and change residency,"When a person immigrates, he or she moves to a new country. During the great wave of immigration between 1880 and 1924, over 25 million Europeans immigrated to the United States.","Many immigrants make significant contributions to their adopted countries. Consider Albert Einstein, the greatest physicist of the twentieth century, who immigrated to America from Germany, or the Russian-born New Yorker Irving Berlin, who wrote some of the most popular songs in the American songbook, including “White Christmas” and “God Bless America."" The word immigrate comes from the Latin imigrare, which means “to move in.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/immigrate
imminent,close in time; about to occur,"Something that is imminent is just about to happen: if you light a firecracker and then stick it down your pants, a very bad situation is imminent.","Imminent is from Latin imminere, ""to overhang,"" and to say that something is imminent is to say that it is hanging over you and about to fall, in a metaphorical way. If you take your mom’s car and drive it into the mailbox, getting grounded is imminent. You don’t want that hanging over your head!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/imminent
immutable,not subject or susceptible to change or variation,"If you can't change it, it's immutable. There are many things in life that are immutable; these unchangeable things include death, taxes, and the laws of physics.","The adjective immutable has Latin roots that mean ""not changeable."" The Latin prefix for not is in, but the spelling changes when the prefix is put before the consonant m. It is im before a root word starting with m as in immutable. If you learn this rule, you'll know the immutable fact that immutable begins with i-m-m.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/immutable
impartial,free from undue bias or preconceived opinions,"If you're in a contest, you'd better hope the judges are impartial. That means that they aren't biased toward one competitor over another.","If you’re partial to the color green, you love green and wear it all the time. If you’re impartial to colors, you don’t care what color you wear. To be impartial is to be objective, so you don’t mind one way or another how something is going to turn out. It’s important for jurors to be impartial when reaching a verdict, rather than allowing biases and preconceptions affect their judgment.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/impartial
impeccable,without fault or error,The adjective impeccable describes something or someone without any flaws. A stand-up comedian needs impeccable timing for her jokes to work.,"The adjective impeccable refers to something or someone without marking or error — but it can describe something spotless or clean. The word comes from the Latin impeccabilis, ""to be sinless,"" which is also an outdated sense in English. You can see how ""clean"" comes from ""sinless."" Because of the messy nature of picnic food, it is highly unlikely that you would leave with your clothing still as impeccable as when you arrived, especially if you like lots of mustard and ketchup!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/impeccable
imperial,belonging to or befitting a supreme ruler,"Imperial carries the implication of royalty, usually pertaining to an empire; the emperor or empress is referred to as ""your imperial highness.""","The word imperial has a lofty feel, and though it's often used of royalty, it is sometimes used to refer to anything extremely large or impressive. It was once the name of a large suitcase that was too big to fit inside a coach and so was tied on top. Think of something imperial as being something so upper-class that it's almost to the point of royalty — and sometimes almost to the point of being a joke.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/imperial
impervious,not admitting of passage or capable of being affected,"An impervious surface is one that can't be penetrated. The word is often followed by ""to,"" as in ""His steely personality made him impervious to jokes about his awful haircut.""","Most of the sentences you'll run across using impervious will be followed by the word ""to"" and a noun. Things are often described as being impervious to physical assaults like heat, water, bullets, weather, and attack, but just as frequently to less tangible things, like reason, criticism, pain, and pressure. The word comes from Latin: in- + pervius, meaning ""not letting things through."" A common synonym is impermeable.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/impervious
impetuous,characterized by undue haste and lack of thought,"Someone impetuous acts too hastily or carelessly. Hotheaded, impulsive folks are impetuous.","If you're a careful person who thinks everything through and doesn't act rashly, then you're not very impetuous. Impetuous has to do with doing things on the spur of the moment — and not good things. Being impetuous usually goes along with being impatient and easily angered. If you're impetuous, you act quickly and thoughtlessly when you should just take a deep breath, relax, and think about the best thing to do.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/impetuous
implement,a piece of equipment or a tool used for a specific purpose,"Apply the noun implement when you want to use a fancy word for ""tool."" A knife and fork are implements for handling food.","The noun implement is a very useful word for just about anything you want to describe as a tool or a thing that helps you do something. An implement can be as simple as chimpanzees using a stick to eat ants with or a bulldozer that moves huge amounts of earth in building. The word relates to something that ""fills up"" a house, as in all sorts of things that allow a house to work properly.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/implement
impotency,the quality of lacking strength or power,,,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/impotency
impugn,attack as false or wrong,"To impugn means to call into question or attack as wrong. If your usually grumpy brother is suddenly nice and sweet, you'll impugn his motives if you're smart — he probably just wants something from you.","The root of impugn is the Latin pugnare which means ""to fight,"" so when you impugn, you are fighting or attacking, but by saying that something is false or wrong. If a candidate has a record that cannot be impugned, his or her opponent might go for a character attack. If you take pride in your work, you will be especially insulted if someone impugns your professionalism or integrity.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/impugn
inane,devoid of intelligence,"If something is inane, it's silly or senseless. If you just want to space out, you won't mind the inane chatter on TV, as long as it's on.","Inane comes from the Latin inanis, for empty, and you can think of it as empty-headed. We call something inane if it states the obvious, or is really silly in a way that seems unintelligent. If you give your boss a presentation in a bunny suit and sing a song about being happy, she might say, ""Get out of here with your inane bunny act!"" Other synonyms are stupid, vacuous, ridiculous, pointless.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/inane
inaugurate,commence officially,"To inaugurate means to start something, to give it a kick off. The opening day pep rally inaugurates the high school football season.","Inaugurate comes from the Latin word augur, which means taking signs from birds, or telling the future. The Romans would always look for good omens to mark the beginning of something––a war, or a new emperor’s reign––so inaugurate became linked to new beginnings. While inaugurate has long been used in formal contexts, such as the swearing-in ceremony that inaugurates a President's term in office, inaugurate is now also used casually. You might inaugurate your marathon training with a long run.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/inaugurate
incandescent,emitting light as a result of being heated,"When heated, coals become incandescent, which means that they glow red-hot. You could also describe a brilliant and moving novel as incandescent.","Incandescent, like the word candle, has its origins in the Latin word candere meaning ""to glow or shine."" Combined with the suffix in meaning ""within,"" its meaning can be easily pulled from the combination of its root words: ""to glow or shine from within."" Fire crackers are incandescent because they give off brilliant lights when heated, but look up at a blazing fireworks display, and you'll find it's quite moving, or incandescent with intensity and brilliance.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/incandescent
incantation,a ritual reciting of words believed to have a magical effect,"""Double, double toil and trouble / Fire burn, and cauldron bubble."" These lines, cackled by the Weird Sisters in Shakespeare's Macbeth, are part of the most famous incantation — or magic spell made of words — in English literature.","Incantation shares a Latin source with enchant, both of which are related to chant. An incantation, then, summons a thing or action into being with words that are sung, spoken, or written. Long before it became the catchword of stage magicians, abracadabra was regarded as a powerful incantation capable of warding off serious disease. The phrase hocus pocus may be a corruption of a seventeenth-century incantation spoken during the Roman Catholic liturgy of the Eucharist, ""hoc est corpus meum"" (""this is my body"").",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/incantation
incense,make furious,"Incense means both ""to make angry"" and a stick that burns slowly and emits a strong smell. If your new college roommate burns incense in your tiny dorm room, you might get incensed and storm out.","How can a word that means a substance that is burned for its sweet odor come to mean ""make very angry""? Both have to do with the idea of burning, and the Latin root incendere, ""to set on fire."" A stick of incense must be lit, or set on fire to release its smell. When you are incensed by something, such as your teacher slamming you with homework on the night of the prom, you feel like you are burning with anger.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/incense
incessant,uninterrupted in time and indefinitely long continuing,"Something incessant continues without interruption. When you're on a cross-country flight, it's tough to tolerate the incessant crying of a baby.","In Latin, cessare means ""to stop,"" so when you add the negative prefix in-, you get a word meaning ""never stopping."" A near synonym is continual, but something incessant is more relentless; ceaseless is a closer synonym. It's rare to find incessant used in a positive way. Even incessant sunshine would grow boring.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/incessant
incipient,only partly in existence; imperfectly formed,"Incipient means something is in an early stage of existence. In its incipient form, basketball was played with a soccer ball and peach baskets for goals. Bouncy orange balls and nets came later.","Incipient comes from the Latin incipere ""to begin."" The related, and more commonly used, word inception means the beginning or the start. It is important to note that when something is in an incipient stage, there is a chance it will never come to completion. So be on the lookout for incipient trouble or an incipient crisis — you might be able to prevent it from happening.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/incipient
incisive,demonstrating ability to recognize or draw fine distinctions,"The adjective incisive describes something that is sharp, decisive, and direct. A comment that cuts right to the bone can be just as incisive as an actual knife.","The word incisive is rooted in a Latin word that literally means ""to cut with a sharp edge."" To help you remember the meaning, you can think of the similar word, incisors, which are the teeth that are sharp and cut and tear. The more figurative meaning of describing something that is mentally sharp first appeared in the 1850s. Keen criticism and cutting remarks have been called incisive ever since.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/incisive
incongruous,lacking in harmony or compatibility or appropriateness,"Something that's incongruous is inconsistent or incompatible with something else. Remember that Sesame Street song ""One of these things is not like the other""? They were talking about that one thing being incongruous.","If we break it down into its Latin roots, incongruous is formed by adding in, meaning “not,"" to congruous, which means “suitable, proper.” So, something that is incongruous is ""not suitable or proper"" — in other words, not in harmony with everything else. That's why burping at the dinner table could be called incongruous behavior: it's not proper and certainly doesn't go well with the main course.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/incongruous
incorrigible,impervious to correction by punishment,"Someone incorrigible seems to be beyond correcting, improving, or changing. When you talk about an incorrigible bully, you're saying they're always going to push other people around.","Even though incorrigible implies a person is kind of hopeless, it's often used as a light-hearted word. When we describe someone as an incorrigible flirt or as an incorrigible gossip, we mean that this is just the way they are, and it would be foolish to try and change them. If someone is just being obnoxious as usual, you could say ""You're incorrigible!""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/incorrigible
increment,the amount by which something increases,"Consider expanding your vocabulary by a small increment, or increase, each day. Increasing your vocabulary by an increment of just two words a day means you’ll learn more than 700 new words a year!","Increment is often used in the context of a series of regular increases, so this word comes in handy whenever you’re expanding or improving something over time. Maybe you contribute to your bank account in modest increments each week. Or, when working out at the gym, perhaps you increase the number of sit-ups you do by a small increment each day.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/increment
indifferent,marked by a lack of interest,"If you're indifferent about something, you don't care much about it one way or another. You might feel indifferent about politics, changing the channel whenever the TV news comes on.","People seem indifferent when they're obviously unconcerned — an indifferent observer of a tennis match is clearly not rooting for either player, and an indifferent voter might choose a candidate at the last minute by flipping a coin. A slightly less common meaning of indifferent is ""unbiased or impartial,"" which you can see in its root, the Old French indifferent, or ""impartial."" In this sense of the word, we all hope our laws and legal system are indifferent.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/indifferent
indigenous,originating where it is found,"Use indigenous to describe a plant, animal or person that is native or original to an area. Though Switzerland is known for its chocolates, chocolate, which comes from the cocoa plant, is indigenous to South America.","Indigenous, aboriginal, and native all mean the same thing. Aboriginal, however, is commonly used in connection with Australia, and native with North America. The most neutral of the three terms, indigenous comes from the Latin word, indigena meaning ""a native."" An indigenous ceremony or religion is one traditionally used by a certain group of people.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/indigenous
indigent,poor enough to need help from others,"An indigent person is extremely poor, lacking the basic resources of a normal life. Often the indigent lack not only money but homes.","Indigent comes from a Latin word meaning wanting, which we used to use to mean “lacking” and not just to describe desires. Homeless shelters, soup kitchens, free medical clinics and court-appointed lawyers are all institutions that our society has developed to help indigent people.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/indigent
indignant,angered at something unjust or wrong,"When you're indignant, you're angry about an unfair situation. If you discovered that a teacher gave ten extra points on a test to all students who sat in the front row, you'd be indignant.","Indignant is from Latin indignus ""unworthy,"" and it refers to anger based on unworthy or unfair behavior rather than merely injury to one's own interests. You may be angry, even furious, if someone shoves you, but you are indignant if the shove is directed at someone weak or helpless. The related noun is indignation, and something that arouses indignation is an indignity.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/indignant
indolent,disinclined to work or exertion,Indolent is an adjective meaning slow or lazy. It can take an indolent teenager hours to get out of bed on a weekend morning. Often it's noon before he finally comes shuffling down to breakfast in his pajamas.,"An indolent person is slow and lazy — not the type of person you'd want running your corporation or competing with you in a relay race. Doctors use the word indolent to describe medical conditions that are slow to progress. If you're diagnosed with an illness, you'd prefer an indolent one over one that spreads quickly.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/indolent
indulgent,given to yielding to the wishes of someone,"Someone who is self-indulgent gives themselves a lot of treats. Parents who are indulgent cave to every desire their child expresses. Indulgent means lenient, or overly generous.","Indulgent is a word that, here in Puritanical North America, is hard to know how to take. Is it okay to “indulge yourself” as so many spa advertisements suggest? Or is indulgent always associated with excess? You can indulge fantasies of figuring out the answer, or you can give in to an indulgent shrug and move on to another word.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/indulgent
ineffable,defying expression or description,"Anything ineffable is unspeakably beautiful, moving, or horrible. It’s beyond expression. If something is so powerful or emotional that you can't even describe it, it’s ineffable.","Ineffable ideas and emotions are difficult to put into words. Parents might feel an ineffable sadness and pride when watching their youngest child graduate from high school. Ineffable can also be used to describe a name that is so sacred you’re not allowed to say it.This word comes from the adjective effable, which means “something that can lawfully be expressed in words,” and isn’t used much anymore.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ineffable
inept,generally incompetent and ineffectual,"A clumsy, incompetent person — or an ineffective action — is inept. When you're inept, you don't know what you're doing or just can't get it done.","Someone inept is bumbling, clueless, and ineffective. Inept people are dumb or clueless; they don't understand things. More than that, inept people are bad at what they do. An inept lawyer always loses cases. An inept figure skater wipes out on the ice. An inept postal worker loses mail and puts it in the wrong box. An inept person is downright bad at something. The opposite of inept is competent.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/inept
inert,slow and apathetic,"Something that's unable to move or moving without much energy can be described as inert. Wind up in a body cast and you’ll find yourself not only itchy, but totally inert.","When motion is restricted or sluggish, or when something or someone appears lifeless, the adjective to use is inert. A dog who's playing dead is inert, as is a really boring movie. Or for those of you paying attention in chemistry class, you may have heard of inert gases — those elements that won't react with other elements or form chemical compounds.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/inert
inexorable,impossible to persuade by means of pleas or reason,"When a person is inexorable, they're stubborn. When a thing or process is inexorable, it can't be stopped.","This is a word for people and things that will not change direction. An inexorable person is hard-headed and cannot be convinced to change their mind, no matter what. You can also say that a process, like the progress of a deadly illness, is inexorable because it can't be stopped. A speeding train with no brakes is inexorable; it's not stopping till it crashes. When you see the word inexorable, think ""No one's stopping that.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/inexorable
infamous,known widely and usually unfavorably,"Someone who is infamous has a very bad reputation. If you become a Hollywood star and find yourself on the pages of gossip magazines for your affairs and addictions, you will have succeeded in becoming infamous.","Infamous is from Latin infamis, for negative fame. If you're bad but unknown, then you're not infamous — it's reserved for those wicked and well-known people that capture our collective imagination. It is a strong and resonant term. Some synonyms are notorious, disgraceful, and odious. The stress is on the first syllable.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/infamous
infatuated,marked by foolish or unreasoning fondness,"Think he has no faults? Blush when he walks by? You are infatuated. When you are infatuated, your crush is so severe that it's pretty darned foolish.","Infatuation comes from the Latin infature which means ""to make a fool of.""

infer,conclude by reasoning,"When you infer something, you read between the lines. To infer is to make a well informed guess — if you see your mom’s bag on the table, you might infer that she’s home.","When you infer, you listen closely to someone and guess at things they mean but haven't actually said. It’s like guessing, but not making wild guesses. You're making deductions — guesses based on logic. Another kind of inferring is more scientific, like when a scientist has part of a dinosaur fossil and can infer what the rest of the dinosaur looked like. When you see the word infer, think ""educated guess.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/infer
infinitesimal,immeasurably small,"When it's incalculably small, when teensy seems large compared to it, then it is infinitesimal. ""The equipment was so sensitive that even the infinitesimal dust molecules that swept in with the open door altered the readings.""","Infinitesimal is such an extreme description of a microscopic something that the word is used as an exaggeration more often than to describe something actually quite small. ""The chances of Roxy going out on a date with Norbert were infinitesimal. She barely even knew he existed."" Infinitesimal has as its root infinite which usually conjures up thoughts of immeasurably large quantities or sizes. In this case infinite refers to something immeasurably small.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/infinitesimal
ingenuous,lacking in sophistication or worldliness,"Someone who is ingenuous shows a childlike innocence, trust, and openness. One of the things kindergarten teachers value is the chance to work with kids while they're still relatively ingenuous––their open, trusting natures are a joy.","A near synonym is naive. Its opposite is disingenuous, which means ""giving a false impression of being honest and sincere."" Don't confuse the word ingenuous with the similarly spelled ingenious, which means ""very smart or clever."" Ingenuous is from Latin ingenuus ""having the qualities of people born free, noble, honest, open,"" ultimately formed from the prefix in- ""in"" plus gignere ""to produce.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ingenuous
inherent,existing as an essential constituent or characteristic,Use the adjective inherent for qualities that are considered permanent or cannot be separated from an essential character.,"We use the adjective inherent to describe attributes that are part of the essential nature of something.

So, for example, if you have never been able to eat spinach, you have an inherent dislike of it.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/inherent
injunction,a judicial remedy to prohibit a party from doing something,"If your school begins building a swimming pool on land that does not belong to it, the city might issue an injunction to stop it. An injunction is an official order issued by a judge.","In general injunctions are court ordered settlements or commands. In the United States, judges cannot create laws, but they can require someone to do something or to stop doing something. If you were wrongly fired from a job, a court may issue an injunction to your former employer, requiring him or her to hire you back or pay your back salary.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/injunction
innate,present at birth but not necessarily hereditary,"If a characteristic or ability is already present in a person or animal when they are born, it is innate. People have the innate ability to speak whereas animals do not.","Innate can also be used figuratively for something that comes from the mind rather than from external sources.

There is an innate sadness in certain types of ceremonies.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/innate
innocuous,not injurious to physical or mental health,"Something that's innocuous isn't harmful or likely to cause injury. Public figures like mayors and governors have to expect they'll get critical or even hurtful emails and phone calls, as well as more innocuous feedback.","The adjective innocuous is useful when you're talking about something that doesn't offend or injure anyone. Innocuous remarks or comments are meant kindly, and innocuous germs won't make you sick. An innocuous question is innocently curious, rather than aimed to hurt someone's feelings. The word comes from the Latin roots in-, ""not,"" and nocere, ""to injure or harm.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/innocuous
insatiable,"impossible to fulfill, appease, or gratify","If someone can't be satisfied, she is insatiable. After being lost in the woods eating only berries for a few days, you'll find your hunger is insatiable once you finally get to the table.","Insatiable comes from the combination of the negative prefix, in- and the Latin verb satiare, for fill. Someone who is insatiable can never be full. It can be used for spiritual as well as physical desires. Swift's traveling Gulliver talks about his ""insatiable desire of seeing foreign countries."" Perhaps you have an insatiable desire to learn all the words in the English language. Synonyms are unappeasable and gluttonous.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/insatiable
insidious,working or spreading in a hidden and usually injurious way,"If something is slowly and secretly causing harm, it's insidious — like the rumors no one seems to listen to until suddenly someone's reputation is ruined.","Insidious is related to the Latin noun, īnsidiae meaning ""ambush"" which comes from the Latin verb, īnsidēre ""to lie in wait for."" This is very fitting as an insidious rumor or problem is one whose negative effect is not realized until the damage is already done. Similarly, an insidious disease develops internally without symptoms, so that you don't realize right away that you are sick.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/insidious
insinuate,suggest in an indirect or covert way; give to understand,"Insinuate means you imply or suggest something that may or may not be true. If you say things seemed to go wrong about the time your brother took over, you insinuate that he had something to do with the decline.","There's another way to insinuate. Suppose you're in line to get into a popular dance club when a celebrity appears, surrounded by a big entourage. If you strike up a conversation with one of the entourage, you may be able to insinuate that you're part of the group and go in with them. Don't feel bad — people have been doing it at least since the 1520s, when insinuate evolved from the Latin word insinuare, meaning ""wind one's way into.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/insinuate
insipid,lacking taste or flavor or tang,Something insipid is lacking in flavor or interest. You'll probably find the generic poems inside of greeting cards insipid.,"Insipid comes from the Latin insipidus, the opposite of sapidus which means flavorful. Because spices and salts are left out, hospital food is usually considered insipid. The most common use of the word is in a metaphorical sense for dull or flat.

insolent,marked by casual disrespect,"Someone who's insolent is either really doing her own thing, even if it goes against what everyone else is doing, or she’s mildly disrespectful.","That student in your class who is constantly snubbing the teacher, snorting when he gives assignments, and rolling her eyes when he reads passages aloud from your vocabulary textbook? Insolent, definitely insolent. There might be another student who adorns her school uniform with pins and ribbons, cuts her hair shorter than the dress code allows, and rolls her socks down. This student is also insolent, in the sense that she defies the rules.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/insolent
instigate,provoke or stir up,"When you instigate something, you start it, but the word carries conflict with it. If you are suspended for wearing a political t-shirt, the incident might instigate days of protest by students and faculty.","Instigate comes from the Latin word instigare ""to incite."" People who are instigators often begin trouble but then back off and let others break the rules. If you instigate a food fight in the cafeteria, you might throw the first spoonful of mashed potatoes, but then you stop and let all the other students carry on the chaos.

insular,relating to or characteristic of or situated on an island,"Insular means ""having a narrow view of the world,"" like insular people who never leave their small town, which enables them to believe that every place in the world is the same and the people are all just like them.","The adjective insular comes from the Latin word insula, which means “island.” Perhaps less so in our current age of technological and relatively easy travel, island life can still be separated from the rest.

Such an experience will help you expand your insular views.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/insular
insurgent,in opposition to a civil authority or government,"An insurgent is a rebel or a revolutionary, someone who takes up arms against the authorities.","Insurgent is from the Latin word “insurgentem,” literally meaning “to rise against,” so think of an insurgent as a fighter who rises against the people in power.

integral,existing as an essential constituent or characteristic,"Something that is integral is very important or necessary. If you are an integral part of the team, it means that the team cannot function without you.","An integral part is necessary to complete the whole.

intractable,difficult to manage or mold,"Can't manage your stubborn little brother who won't do what anyone says? You could call him intractable, or you could call your mother. Problems are intractable when they can't be solved.","Intractable means not tractable. Helpful, right? No? Let's break it down. In both words you see the word tract.

intrinsic,belonging to a thing by its very nature,The intrinsic qualities of something have to do with its nature.

introspective,given to examining own sensory and perceptual experiences,"Someone who is introspective spends considerable time examining his own thoughts and feelings. If you take to your diary after an unhappy break-up, you are being introspective.","The Latin word introspicere means to look inside, and that's what an introspective person does, metaphorically speaking.

inundate,"fill or cover completely, usually with water","To inundate means to quickly fill up or overwhelm, just like a flood. Your bathroom could be inundated with water if the pipes burst, and hopefully your inbox is inundated with nice emails on your birthday.","Commonly used to refer to a deluge of water, inundate can also refer to an overflow of something less tangible, like information.

I'm sure you can think of harsher and more obscene examples, but we won't get into them here.","Invective comes from the Latin for ""abusive.""

irascible,quickly aroused to anger,"If you're irascible, you get angry easily — perhaps blowing up in rage when someone brushes into you.","Irascible comes from the Latin root ira, which means ""anger"" or ""rage,"" the same root that gives us the word ire, ""anger."" The -sc in the middle of irascible, means ""becoming,"" so irascible doesn't just mean you're angry — it's got action built into it.

If you're the world chess champion, it would be pretty ironic if you lost a match to someone who just learned to play yesterday.","Ironic is the adjective for the noun irony. In contemporary speech, when we call something ironic, we often mean sarcastic. If you spill coffee all over drawings you've been working on all morning, you might ironically tell your coworker, ""I've done something wonderful!""

irrevocable,incapable of being retracted,"If you're on a diet but eat one tiny piece of chocolate, it might start an irrevocable slide into bad eating. Describe something as irrevocable if it cannot be undone or taken back.","If you break down irrevocable, you wind up with ir ""not,"" re ""back"" and vocable from the Latin vocare ""to call.""

itinerant,traveling from place to place to work,"An itinerant is a person who moves from place to place, typically for work, like the itinerant preacher who moves to a new community every few years.","Itinerant is pronounced ""eye-TIN-er-ant.""

NOT judicious.","As its sound implies, judicious comes from the same Latin word from which we get judge and judiciary, and not surprisingly a judicious decision is one that only comes after all sides have been weighed up and opposing points of view taken into consideration. Judicious decisions are never split-second decisions.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/judicious
juxtapose,place side by side,"See the word ""pose"" in juxtapose? When you juxtapose, you are ""posing"" or positioning things side by side.","The verb juxtapose requires contrasting things placed next to one other: ""The collage juxtaposed pictures of Jane while she was growing up and as an adult.""

Kinetic comes from a Greek verb meaning ""to move.""","Used generally, kinetic can simply mean ""animated,"" ""dynamic,"" or ""lively,"" but it also has more specific meanings in the realms of art and science. Kinetic drawings, sculptures, and installations have moving parts. Alexander Calder's mobiles are well-known examples of kinetic art. In physics, the phrase ""kinetic energy"" is used to describe the energy of motion. Any object in motion possesses kinetic energy, and this energy can be harnessed, transferred, and transformed to do work: Think of wind turning turbines to generate electricity.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/kinetic

In figurative use, a labyrinth is a complicated situation: our tax code is a labyrinth of rules and regulations.","In Greek mythology, the Labyrinth was the structure built for King Minos of Crete to confine the Minotaur, a monster with the head of a bull and the body of a man. The word maze is a near synonym for labyrinth, and is also used figuratively, as in, ""After war broke out, trying to figure out how to get a visa to leave the country was like navigating a maze, a veritable labyrinth of wrong turns and false hope.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/labyrinth
laconic,brief and to the point,"Laconic is an adjective that describes a style of speaking or writing that uses only a few words, often to express complex thoughts and ideas. A more laconic way to write that last sentence might be this: laconic means brief.","There’s a friend of yours who doesn’t talk very much, and when he does, he says maybe three words and then becomes quiet again. You could describe that friend as laconic. The word comes from Laconia, a region in ancient Greece where the local Spartan rulers gave very short speeches.

There's also an old literary form called ""a lament,"" which expresses feelings of loss in a long dramatic poem.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/lament
lampoon,ridicule with satire,"When you make fun of something by imitating it in a humorous way, you're lampooning it. The writers at The Onion, Saturday Night Live and FunnyOrDie.com are all experts in the art of the lampoon.","Lampoon can be both a verb and a noun. To lampoon is ridicule. A lampoon is a parody or satire. Imagine you were frustrated by having your allowance reduced, so you wrote a funny play portraying mom and dad as dictators extracting lots of unfair taxes from their people. That's lampooning. And it probably won't help your allowance situation.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/lampoon
languish,become feeble,"To languish is to become pitiful or weak because you're sick, in love, or stuck somewhere. A prisoner might languish in jail, longing for her freedom.","Languish, like languid, is from the Latin word languere which means ""to be weak or faint.""

largess,liberality in bestowing gifts,,,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/largess
latent,potentially existing but not presently evident or realized,"Latent is an adjective that you use to describe something that is capable of becoming active or at hand, though it is not currently so.","The adjective latent is a tricky word to define because it refers to something there but not there. That is, latent means something that is capable of becoming active or at hand but has not yet achieved that state. The word arrived in Middle English from the Latin word latēre which means ""to lie hidden."" It can have somewhat negative connotations because it is often used in a medical context, as in a latent illness or infection, but it can also mean good things, such as someone discovering they have latent talents or capabilities.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/latent

Being sleepy or hungry can make anyone lethargic.","Being lethargic makes it hard to get anything done: you feel weak and sleepy. Whatever the reason, a lethargic person needs to snap out of it and get some energy, maybe by eating something or by taking a nap. Being lethargic also goes well with watching TV, since that takes almost no energy at all. When you feel lethargic, you don't have any energy to spare.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/lethargic
levity,a manner lacking seriousness,"Joking that your dead grandmother ""never looked better"" could inject some levity, or frivolity, into her funeral, but your relatives might find your joke inappropriate to the occasion.","Levity literally means ""lightness,"" and it's often an attempt to inject some lightness or humor into an otherwise somber situation. Telling your Aunt Edna a joke while she recuperates from a skiing accident could provide the levity needed to brighten her mood. Yet levity is often used to describe humor that's not appropriate to the occasion, like telling your Aunt the joke, ""Two corpses walk into a bar..."" after her husband has just died.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/levity
libel,a false and malicious publication,Libel is the act of publishing a statement about someone that is not true and that gives a bad impression about the person.,"Libel is usually contrasted with slander, which refers to a spoken statement that is not true.

Litigating mostly takes place in court.,"If you're litigating, you'd better have a lawyer: you're involved in some sort of legal situation. When you sue someone, that's litigating. The person sued is also forced to litigate. People accused of a crime have to litigate when they're on trial. There are many types of litigation. Lawyers usually specialize in one type of litigating, such as criminal law or corporate law.

So a loquacious person is a person who talks a lot, and often too much. Sitting next to a loquacious person at a dinner party can make dinner a real drag.

All you will have to do is smile and eat.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/loquacious
lucid,transparently clear; easily understandable,"Something that's lucid is clear and understandable. Lucid writing is important in journalism, so that readers easily get the point of the article they're reading.","When what you write or say is lucid, it's straightforward and its meaning is crystal clear. You can also use the adjective lucid to describe your mind or thoughts when you're thinking in a rational, sensible way: ""I was worried about my grandmother's confusion yesterday, but she seems really lucid today.""

lugubrious,excessively mournful,"Funerals are lugubrious. So are rainy days and Mondays. Anything that makes you sad, gloomy, or mournful can be called lugubrious.","Lugubrious comes from the Latin verb lūgēre, ""to mourn."" You can also listen to the sound of the word: lugubrious sounds slow, heavy, and sad. Sometimes, just the ""feel"" of a word is enough to clue you in to its meaning, and lugubrious is one of those words. I was feeling great when I got to the concert, but the lugubrious music left me in a terrible mood.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/lugubrious

Politicians love a good machination, and their machinations are frequently exposed in the press as scandals.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/machination

Letting your little sister have the last of the cookies, even though you hadn't eaten since breakfast, would be considered a magnanimous act.","Magnanimous comes from Latin magnus ""great"" and animus ""soul,"" so it literally describes someone who is big-hearted. A person can show that over-sized spirit by being noble or brave, or by easily forgiving others and not showing resentment.

Being magnanimous doesn't require doling out tons of cash — just being an understanding and tolerant soul will do the trick.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/magnanimous
magnate,a very wealthy or powerful businessperson,"If you’re a hugely successful businessperson, particularly if you’ve cornered the market in a specific area, you’re a magnate.

In the twentieth century, the stock of a magnate has rather fallen. If you’re vulgar and loud-spoken as well as rich, you’re probably a magnate.

Wherever you turn, there's malaise.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/malaise
malfeasance,wrongful conduct by a public official,"Whenever you see the prefix ""mal-,"" you know it's not good.

If you know French, fease-, faise- will ring a bell, as it often means ""to do."" You can probably then infer that malfeasance means ""to do bad."" Today, it's usually a bad deed done by an official or an organization.

malignant,dangerous to health,"For something that's very harmful, especially a tumor that's cancerous, use the term malignant.","Malignant and its opposite benign are medical terms used to describe a tumor or growth as either cancerous or not respectively.

One theory says that mal, or ""wrongly,"" suggests the sick person is just faking.

malleable,capable of being shaped or bent,"A malleable metal is able to be pounded or pressed into various shapes, and a malleable personality is capable of being changed or trained.

The adjective malleable dates back to Middle English, from Old French, from Medieval Latin malleābilis, from malleāre, ""to hammer.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/malleable
mandate,a document giving an official instruction or command,"A mandate is an official command or a go-ahead. When a politician wins an election by a wide margin, that's a mandate to implement her ideas.","A mandate gives authority. If the government gives schools a mandate to test more, then the schools had better give more tests.

When you have a mandate, it's like a ticket to get something done.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/mandate

As an adjective, manifest is a formal way to say that something is apparent to the senses and is synonymous with evident, apparent, or clear.

A ship or plane's manifest is the list of cargo or passengers on a particular trip.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/manifest
manifesto,a public declaration of intentions,"A manifesto is a public statement stating your views or your intention to do something.

You'll most often hear about a manifesto that's been issued by a group, like a political party or government — for example, a set of new rules that an incoming regime is going to enforce.

You marshal your thoughts, that is, put them in order.","Marshal derives from the Old French mareschal, for stable officer.

If you marshal yourself, you get yourself ready, preparing for action.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/marshal

It refers to almost much anything military, including ""martial law,"" in which the government orders the military to administer the law.

Martial music, usually associated with the military, is usually bright and inspiring.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/martial
martyr,one who voluntarily suffers death,"Someone who suffers, or is even killed, for his or her political or religious beliefs is called a martyr.","Martin Luther King Jr. is often called a martyr in connection with the American civil rights movement.

If you hope to matriculate at a certain school, it means you want to be a student there.","The verb matriculate is often confused the verb graduate — which means a student has completed a course of study.

Diana Vreeland, the legendary editor of Vogue magazine, once said, ""Pink is the navy blue of India.""

If you live in a mansion and have rich friends, you’re part of the upper crust milieu. Go you.","A milieu is both ""surroundings"" and everything that makes up the surroundings.

minuscule,very small,"When something is teeny tiny, it is minuscule. If your mother calls your miniskirt minuscule, it probably means she wants you to change into something a bit less revealing.","In minuscule, you see the word, minus, which means lesser.

It would be misanthropic of you to say that every human being is a greedy, selfish liar.","The Greek word for human is anthropos and misein means ""to hate"", so to be misanthropic is hate humans, to consider them bad or wrong.

This causes you some concern.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/misanthropic

When monolithic is used to describe something societal — like a religion or an organization — it has a slightly negative connotation.

Being monolithic is good for rocks, but not so good for groups of people.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/monolithic
moribund,being on the point of death,"Something that is moribund is almost dead, like a moribund economy that has been stuck in a recession for years.","In Latin, mori means ""to die."" You probably recognize this root in words like mortal, mortician, and mortuary. Moribund means ""near death,"" but it can also mean something that is coming to an end, nearly obsolete, or stagnant.

morose,showing a brooding ill humor,"A morose person is sullen, gloomy, sad, glum, and depressed — not a happy camper.","When someone is morose, they seem to have a cloud of sadness hanging over them. This word is stronger than just sad — morose implies being extremely gloomy and depressed. We all can be morose at times, like after the death of a friend or family member. Whether you're morose due to an event or just because you're feeling blue, you should try skipping or whistling a little tune to perk things up.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/morose
mortify,cause to feel shame,"To mortify someone is to cause them extreme embarrassment. Your mother may not have been trying to mortify you when she showed up at your senior prom with a bunch of unicorn balloons, but she did.","The root of the verb mortify is from the Latin word mors, which means “death.” To mortify something used to mean to destroy its life, but now mortify is mostly used when you feel so ashamed or embarrassed you “want to die.” To punish yourself through deprivation from food or another desire, you can mortify that compulsion, but it’s probably best to just mortify your parents by showing up at their work place with a new mohawk.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/mortify
mundane,found in the ordinary course of events,"An ordinary, unexciting thing can be called mundane: ""Superman hid his heroic feats by posing as his mundane alter ego, Clark Kent.""","Mundane, from the Latin word mundus, ""world,"" originally referred to things on earth. Such things were supposed to be uninteresting when compared to the delights of Heaven; hence the word's present meaning. Writing about reality TV shows, a Newsweek writer opined, ""In reality bizarro-world, the mundane is presented as the spectacular"" — in other words, people's everyday routines are now televised as entertainment.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/mundane
munificent,very generous,"If you give your best friend a bracelet for her birthday, then you’re a good friend. If you give her a diamond bracelet, a racehorse, and an oil well, then you’re a munificent friend, meaning you are very lavish when it comes to giving gifts. (And it’s possible you may also be broke.)","If you’re the generous type, you may already know that the word munificent traces back to the Latin word munificus, meaning “generous or bountiful,"" which in turn originated from the word munus, meaning “gift or service.” Put those two concepts together and you have big-time gift giving on a lavish scale. Use the word munificent to describe instances of over-the-top generosity — think Oprah on a gift-giving binge at Christmastime.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/munificent
myopia,eyesight abnormality in which distant objects appear blurred,"Myopia is nearsightedness, which means you see things more clearly that are closer to your eye.","You probably suffer from myopia if you walk into the living room and notice the chair in front of you but not the chair ten feet away. If you have myopia, things farther away look out of focus. Also, this can mean narrow-mindedness and intolerance. Due to the first kind of myopia, someone might always hold the menu two centimeters from their eyeballs at restaurants. Due to the second kind, someone might avoid people with different opinions from their own.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/myopia
myriad,a large indefinite number,"A myriad is a lot of something. If you’re talking about Ancient Greece, a myriad is ten thousand, but today you can use the word in myriad other ways.","Myriad comes from the Greek myrioi, the word for ten thousand, or less specifically, a countless amount. Myriad can be a noun, like a myriad of choices, or an adjective, like when you study myriad subjects in college. If you lift a rock you might find a myriad of bugs. Sticklers often look down their noses at using myriad as a noun, but that usage came first.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/myriad
narcissism,an exceptional interest in and admiration for yourself,"Do you have a friend who constantly turns the conversation to themselves, as in ""That's great about your winning the award but do you think these pants look good on me?"" They're putting their narcissism, or excessive love of self, on display.","In psychoanalysis, narcissism is erotic gratification derived from excessive love for yourself, and is considered to be a normal developmental stage.

nebulous,lacking definite form or limits,"Something that's nebulous is clouded or hazy. When you walk through the woods on a foggy morning, the trees may all have a mysterious, nebulous look to them.","When you fly in a plane on an overcast day, the land below you looks nebulous and indistinct. You can also use nebulous in a more figurative way, to describe vague ideas or fuzzy concepts. Nebulous comes from the Latin nebulosus, ""cloudy, misty, or foggy."" Its root is nebula, which is ""vapor or fog"" in Latin and was adopted by astronomers in the 1700s to mean ""a cloud of gas and dust in outer space.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/nebulous
nefarious,extremely wicked,Describe a person's actions as nefarious if they are evil or wicked. Batman and Superman are always fighting evildoers and stopping their nefarious plots.,"Nefarious comes from the Latin nefas ""crime, impiety."" If something is nefarious, it is criminal, evil, malicious and wicked. Thinking of superheroes can help you remember the meaning of the word, but it is often used in much less exciting circumstances. News reporters investigate corrupt politicians in order to uncover the nefarious activities. And, if you don't pay for your downloaded music, you have gotten it by nefarious means.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/nefarious
neologism,a newly invented word or phrase,"A neologism is a made-up or new word. Neologisms can be fun-ti-ful, but the problem is making sure others understand what you mean.","The word neologism was once a neologism itself. It was created by gluing the French prefix neo- onto the Greek logos or ""word."" People coin neologisms all the time, linguists track which ones stick, and eventually, we all feel they're old friends. Or maybe not: random samples from words coined in 2003 include: adultolescence, pastability, pre-zactly, and neomaxizoomdweebie.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/neologism
nepotism,favoritism shown to relatives or friends by those in power,"Nepotism is the practice of favoritism based on kinship, like when the coach chooses his own kid to be the quarterback even if his kid stinks at football.","The word nepotism comes from the Italian word for nephew, nepote. Apparently back in the 17th century a lot of people tended to promote their nephews to powerful positions at the expense of other candidates. Nepotism has come to mean favoritism of any family member, so if you’re the daughter of a powerful CEO, don’t worry, you can still be the beneficiary of nepotism. However, people might not like you when you become the Vice President, unless you’ve really earned the title.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/nepotism
nihilism,complete denial of established authority and institutions,"If you're one of those people who believe there's nothing worth believing in, your doctrine is nihilism. In philosophy, nihilism is the complete rejection of moral values and religious beliefs.","It is such a negative outlook that it denies any meaning or purpose in life. In political theory, nihilism is carried to an even greater extreme, arguing for the destruction of all existing political and social institutions. The term nihilism was borrowed from German Nihilismus, since the doctrine was developed by the German philosopher Friedrich Jacobi. The German word is formed from Latin nihil ""nothing"" plus the suffix –ismus ""a doctrine or theory.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/nihilism
nominal,insignificantly small; a matter of form only,"Schools, libraries, and other organizations often ask you to make a nominal donation to their cause. While you want to support many causes, these nominal donations soon add up to a substantial portion of your budget!","Another meaning for the adjective nominal is ""in name only"" or only having a title.

He is the go-to person for signing invoices, purchase orders, and resolving personnel issues.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/nominal
nostalgia,a longing for something past,Think of the noun nostalgia when you long for the good old days of the past.,"The noun nostalgia was invented by a Swiss doctor in the late 1600s. He put together the Greek nostos ""homecoming"" and algos ""pain, distress"" as a literal translation of the German Heimweh ""homesickness.""

Think of the dreamy way your grandpa tells stories of his childhood — he's got nostalgia.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/nostalgia
notorious,known widely and usually unfavorably,"Use the adjective notorious to describe people, places, or things that are famous for a bad reason.","A good synonym for notorious is infamous; both words mean ""well-known, and not in a good way."" A celebrity convicted of a series of crimes might be referred to as notorious, as might a book that has been banned in several countries. The word originally meant just ""famous"" and could carry either positive or negative connotations. Only in recent centuries did the negative uses start to outweigh the positive ones.

novel,an extended fictional work in prose,"If something is so new and original that it's never been seen, used or even thought of before, call it novel. The noun novel describes a book-length work of fiction.","New and novel come from the same Indo-European root but by different paths. Whereas new is a Germanic word coming from Old English, novel is based on Latin novellus ""new, young, fresh."" If something is novel, it is new but also original, fresh and unique. Companies are always looking for that novel idea that will earn them millions and skydiving is a novel experience, especially if you're not adventurous.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/novel
noxious,injurious to physical or mental health,"Something noxious is harmful and could be even fatal — whether it is colorless, odorless, and invisible like carbon monoxide, or dark, strong-smelling, and obvious, like black smoke from a fire. People are called noxious too when they hurt others with cruelty or mental anguish.","English and Latin roots for noxious are related to the meanings of ""harm,"" ""damage,"" and ""injury."" While obnoxious might come to mind when seeing the word noxious, obnoxious is a much less damaging adjective to describe someone annoying. Most uses for noxious involve real physical or emotional damage unless the word is used in exaggeration. Examples range from ""the noxious gas fumes made the dog pass out"" to ""his cologne was so noxious I had to exit the elevator and take the stairs.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/noxious
nuance,a subtle difference in meaning or opinion or attitude,"Use nuance to refer to a very small difference in color, meaning, or feeling. What makes singers brilliant is not how loud they can sing a note, but how many nuances they can evoke through their approach.","Pronounced ""NOO-ahns,"" this noun was borrowed from French in the 18th century and derives ultimately from Latin nūbēs ""a cloud."" Think of clouds––subtle gradations in color to understand this word. When you say a work of art was nuanced, it means there was a lot to it, but incorporated subtly.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/nuance
obdurate,stubbornly persistent in wrongdoing,"Obdurate is a formal word meaning stubborn. If you want to major in English, but your parents are obdurate that you should go premed, they might go so far as to threaten not to pay your tuition.","This adjective descends from Latin obdurare, ""to harden."" A near synonym is adamant, from Latin adamas, ""hard metal, diamond.""

obfuscate,make obscure or unclear,"Some people are experts at obfuscating the truth by being evasive, unclear, or obscure in the telling of the facts. The people who are good at obfuscating would include defense lawyers and teenagers asked about their plans for Saturday night.","Although the verb obfuscate can be used in any case where something is darkened, less clear, or more obscure, it is most frequently used in reference to things like ideas, facts, issues, or the truth. The usual implied meaning is that this obfuscation is done deliberately. Politicians often obfuscate the truth about the issues to win support for their positions so they can win elections.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/obfuscate
oblivion,the state of being disregarded or forgotten,"Oblivion is the state of being forgotten. If you slip into oblivion after selling one record, then your only hope is becoming a ""VH1 one-hit wonder.""","Oblivion can also mean ""total forgetfulness"" — like what patients with dementia or new parents feel.

Enjoy it while it lasts.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/oblivion
oblique,slanting or inclined in direction or course or position,"If something is oblique, it has a slanting position or direction. In figurative use, oblique means indirect or purposely misleading. ""What is two plus two?"" ""Fish!"" as an answer is completely oblique.","In math, this adjective refers to geometric lines or planes that are not parallel or perpendicular to a line or surface.

obscure,not clearly understood or expressed,"If something is obscure, it's vague and hard to see. Be careful if you're driving in heavy rain — the painted lines can be obscure.","Obscure comes from Latin obscurus, which can mean ""dark, dim,"" ""unclear, hard to understand,"" or ""insignificant, humble."" We tend to use obscure in the metaphorical senses: an obscure sound is unclear, an obscure village is hidden away in the countryside, and an obscure poet is little known and probably insignificant. Obscure can also be used as a verb. If you get really nervous when you speak during a debate, your embarrassing twitches and shaking hands can obscure your argument.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/obscure
obsequious,attempting to win favor from influential people by flattery,If you disapprove of the overly submissive way someone is acting — like the teacher's pet or a celebrity's assistant — call them by the formal adjective obsequious.,"There are many words in the English language for a person or an action that is overly obedient and submissive. Obsequious people are usually not being genuine; they resort to flattery and other fawning ways to stay in the good graces of authority figures. An obsequious person can be called a bootlicker, a brownnoser or a toady. You can also say that someone gives an obsequious bow, a gesture that means, ""your wish is my command.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/obsequious
obtuse,slow to learn or understand; lacking intellectual acuity,"The adjective obtuse is good for describing someone slow on the uptake: ""Don't be so obtuse: get with the program!""","The adjective obtuse literally means ""rounded"" or ""blunt,"" but when it's used for a person, it means ""not quick or alert in perception"" — in other words, not the sharpest tool in the shed. It's not just for dull people, but also dull angles: in geometry, an obtuse angle is one that is not so sharp (between 90 and 180 degrees).",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/obtuse
officious,intrusive in a meddling or offensive manner,"Though officious sounds like official, it means being annoyingly eager to do more than is required. ""The officious lunch lady made everyone's food choices her business, and made nasty comments when students chose cookies over carrots.""","Officious is a tricky word as it seems like it might mean something like office or official. Instead, it is a word to describe someone that acts more official than they actually are. People who are officious are busybodies. They want to make their opinions known and followed, despite not having any kind of real power.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/officious
onerous,burdensome or difficult to endure,"If one teacher gives you three hours of homework a night, that's rough. But if all of your teachers do it, that makes the task of completing your homework an onerous one, to say the least. If something is onerous, it is very difficult to deal with or do.","A near synonym is burdensome. In legal usage, onerous describes a contract or lease that has more obligations than advantages. Onerous derives from Middle English, from Old French onereus, from Latin onerōsus, from onus ""burden.""

opaque,not transmitting or reflecting light or radiant energy,Use the adjective opaque either for something that doesn't allow light to pass through (like a heavy curtain) or for something difficult to understand (like bureaucratic gobbledygook).,"Opaque is from a Latin word meaning ""dark,"" and that was its original sense in English, but it now means literally ""not transparent"" or metaphorically ""hard to understand; unclear"": ""Some of his sentences are really opaque."" It used to be spelled opake, which made the pronunciation clearer, but we then borrowed the more opaque French spelling. Come to think of it, English spelling is often pretty opaque, which makes it hard for learners of the language to master.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/opaque
opulent,rich and superior in quality,"Opulent is a word that you will hear a lot around rich people looking to show off. ""Remember the opulent buffet at Carrie’s sweet sixteen? Sixteen chocolate cakes iced in gold leaf!""","If you want to remember that opulent is a word describing lavish displays of wealth, you can think of the word opal to help you remember it — opal being a rare gem. And if you are lucky enough to be able to afford opulence yourself, don’t describe it that way. The word contains connotations of pretentious. And gold leaf cake aside, who wants that?",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/opulent
orthodox,adhering to what is commonly accepted,"Orthodox practices or beliefs are generally accepted as true or correct. If you are an orthodox vegetarian, you never, ever eat meat — not like those people who have fish once in a while.","When capitalized, Orthodox is the name of the Eastern Church, originally distinguished by its doctrinal differences from the other divisions of the Christian Church. Orthodox is also the name of the branch of Judaism that strictly follows traditional beliefs and customs, derived from orthodox in the earlier meaning of ""strictly observant.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/orthodox
ostensible,appearing as such but not necessarily so,When something is ostensible it appears to be the case but might not be. Your ostensible reason for visiting every bakery in town is that you're looking for a part-time job — but I think you really just want to eat cupcakes.,"Just because something is ostensible doesn't necessarily mean that it's not as it appears to be, only that there's a possibility of another reason. Your ostensible reason for calling your crush was to ask about homework; the real reason was that you were hoping they would ask you out. Ostensible derives from the Latin verb ostendere, meaning ""to show or display.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ostensible
ostentatious,intended to attract notice and impress others,"Reach for the adjective ostentatious when you want a flashy way to say — well, ""flashy"" or ""showy.""","No one wants to be described as ostentatious, a word whose cousins include pretentious, flamboyant, and gaudy. It originates from the Latin word ostentare, ""to display,"" but in English it's often used for displays of the crass or vulgar sort. A rapper's diamond-encrusted teeth might be an ostentatious display of ""bling,"" and someone wailing especially loudly at a funeral of a distant acquaintance might be making an ostentatious show of sorrow.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ostentatious
pacify,"ease the anger, agitation, or strong emotion of","If you are bringing peace or calm to a state of unrest, you are pacifying the situation. Just think of the transformation a squalling baby undergoes when a pacifier is placed within his mouth, and you will remember the power of the verb to pacify.","If you work to establish peace in a certain location between factions at war, then you are working to pacify a country or region. The U.N. has specially trained workers, called peace keepers, who go into to trouble spots to try to pacify rebellions factions and restore order.

painstaking,characterized by extreme care and great effort,"If you notice that painstaking is composed of pains and taking, you already have a pretty clear sense of what this adjective means: to be painstaking is to be so careful—so meticulous, so thorough that it hurts.","Painstaking is most commonly paired with detail — in fact, writers might like to avoid the phrase “painstaking detail” as clichéd. In contemporary usage, the agony implied by the word often seems to be shared by both the person who makes a painstaking effort and the person confronted with the fruits of that labor: “Gertrude’s ability to appear politely interested was tested as her dinner companion related his painstaking attempts to establish himself as the true heir to the British throne.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/painstaking
palliate,lessen or to try to lessen the seriousness or extent of,"When you palliate something, you try to make something less bad: “City leaders tried to palliate effects of the trash haulers' strike by distributing extra large garbage cans with tight-fitting lids.”","Palliate is the word to use when you want to make something feel or seem better. Palliate doesn’t mean “cure” or “solve.” Instead, something that palliates relieves the symptoms or consequences of something, without addressing the underlying cause. Your dentist might give you pain-killing drugs to palliate the discomfort caused by an impacted molar, but that molar is still there, waiting to cause more trouble.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/palliate
palpable,capable of being perceived,"When something is palpable, you can touch or handle it, even though the word is often used to describe things that usually can't be handled or touched, such as emotions or sensations.","You probably won't see palpable used to describe, say, an egg or a doorknob or a motorcycle.

When the towers came down, the sense of sadness was so great, it was palpable.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/palpable
paltry,contemptibly small in amount or size,"A paltry amount is so small it's not even worth thinking about. In the novel ""Oliver Twist,"" when Oliver is given a paltry amount of gruel — not nearly enough — he asks, ""Please, sir, can I have some more?""","Paltry is a laughably small amount — the waiter might chuck a paltry tip in the garbage. If you have only 50 cents in your bank account, it's such a paltry amount, you may as well be broke. It can also mean ""not worth considering"" or ""not important."" If you keep breaking your promises, your friends will get sick of your paltry excuses.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/paltry
panacea,hypothetical remedy for all ills or diseases,"If someone offers you a pill that promises eternal life, don’t take the pill. It’s a panacea, a remedy that falsely claims to solve every problem ever.","The Greek word pan means “all” (think of a panorama, a view where you can see everywhere). The Greek word for “cure” is akēs (which looks like the word “aches”). Those are the roots of panacea, a cure for all aches. But a panacea doesn’t really cure everything; it just acts like it can. Use the word to describe an unbelievable solution, like a new law that will make everyone rich, or a robot that does your homework for you.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/panacea
paradigm,a standard or typical example,"A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas. A paradigm is a way of looking at something.","The word paradigm comes up a lot in the academic, scientific, and business worlds. A new paradigm in business could mean a new way of reaching customers and making money.

When you change paradigms, you're changing how you think about something.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/paradigm
paradox,a statement that contradicts itself,"Here's a mind-bender: ""This statement is false."" If you think it's true, then it must be false, but if you think it's false, it must be true. Now that's a paradox!","A paradox is a logical puzzler that contradicts itself in a baffling way. ""This statement is false"" is a classic example, known to logicians as ""the liar's paradox."" Paradoxical statements may seem completely self-contradictory, but they can be used to reveal deeper truths. When Oscar Wilde said, ""I can resist anything except temptation,"" he used a paradox to highlight how easily we give in to tempting things while imagining that we can hold firm and resist them.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/paradox
parochial,narrowly restricted in outlook or scope,"If an issue or a matter is parochial, it is trivial or only concerns a local area. Likewise, a person with a parochial mentality is narrow-minded, or not open to new ideas.","Parochial comes to English from Greek through Latin with the meaning ""of a parish."" As a parochial school is a school that is affiliated with a particular church, the connection is easy to see. In general though, parochial refers to a narrow or limited point of view — that is, an outlook that extends no further than the limits of the parish. You may feel that there is no room in your life for the parochial attitudes of the older generation. Let's hope you remain open-minded as you age!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/parochial

partisan,a fervent and even militant proponent of something,"If something is prejudicial towards a particular point of view, you can call it partisan. You'll often hear of the partisan politics in the U.S.— since politicians seem to be completely devoted to the agendas of their own parties.","Partisan can be used to describe rabid supporters of any person or activity. In American English, however, it is most often used to refer to politics and the American two-party system of Democrats and Republicans.

patriarch,the male head of family or tribe,"A patriarch is a male leader. Your father might be the patriarch of your family, but your kid brother could be the patriarch of his club house.","You can trace patriarch back to its ancient Greek root pater meaning ""father.""

But if someone patronizes you, it's not so pleasant — they talk to you as if you were inferior or not very intelligent.","Patronize comes from Latin patronus ""protector, master,"" related to pater ""father."" So if you patronize a person, you talk down to them like a father might do to his child or a master to his apprentice. If you want to take an advanced class and your advisor warns you of all the hard work, you can tell him to stop patronizing you — you know a hard class involves hard work.

pathology,the branch of medical science that studies diseases,"Pathology is the medical term for the way a disease works. A tumor is removed by a doctor trained in surgery, but you need a doctor trained in pathology to tell you if the tumor is cancer.","Pathology derives from the Greek pathos ""suffering"" and ology ""study of""––to give us ""the study of disease,"" but often pathology means the disease's behavior––the cancer pathology is to take over healthy cells and grow cancerous tumors.

paucity,an insufficient quantity or number,"The word paucity means not enough of something. If you've got a paucity of good cheer, for example, you'd better cheer up!","One good way to remember the meaning of paucity is that it's a bit like pauper, as in The Prince and the Pauper.

Parents recognize that their kids have a few peccadilloes: they don't always remember to say please and thank you, don't put their dirty clothes in the hamper, and worst of all, they keep finding the chocolate stash!","Peccadillo is based on the Spanish word peccado, meaning ""sin,"" with a diminutive added, making peccadillo a small sin. How big a sin is a peccadillo? Well, that depends on whom you ask. The person committing the offense is likely to try to pass off any number of transgressions and mistakes as peccadilloes. If you apologize and are forgiven, it's probably a peccadillo. If your transgression could get you fired, it's probably not!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/peccadillo
pedantic,marked by a narrow focus on or display of learning,"There's nothing wrong with focusing on the details, but someone who is pedantic makes a big display of knowing obscure facts and details.","Pedantic means ""like a pedant,"" someone who's too concerned with literal accuracy or formality. It's a negative term that implies someone is showing off book learning or trivia, especially in a tiresome way.

pejorative,expressing disapproval,Call a word or phrase pejorative if it is used as a disapproving expression or a term of abuse. Tree-hugger is a pejorative term for an environmentalist.,"Coming from the Latin word for ""worse,"" pejorative is both an adjective and a noun. As an adjective, it means disapproving or disparaging. Hack is a pejorative term for a bad writer. If you call someone a politician in the pejorative sense, you mean that they are scheming and out for personal gain. Terms of abuse such as jerk and negative euphemisms such as bottom feeder are pejoratives, words you use when you want to call someone a bad name.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/pejorative
penchant,a strong liking,"A penchant is a strong preference or tendency. If you have a penchant for pizza, you either eat it daily or wish you did.","Penchant borrows from French, in which penchant literally means inclined. It goes back to the Latin pendere, for hanging, which is also the source of pendant. In both French and English, speakers have long used the idea of inclination metaphorically: a hillside can be inclined in one direction or another, and so can a person's thoughts. But in English, penchant is only for desires.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/penchant
penitent,feeling or expressing remorse for misdeeds,"Penitent means deeply sorry, ashamed, and full of remorse. If you feel sorry––or just want to appear to––you should adopt a penitent manner.","Penitent comes from the Latin word paenitere, which means to repent. It can be either noun or adjective.

pensive,deeply or seriously thoughtful,"See that person staring out the window who looks so sad and lost in thought? He is pensive, the opposite of cheery and carefree.","If you've studied Spanish, you know that the verb pensar means ""to think.""

Outside of the courtroom, a peremptory manner is just plain rude.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/peremptory
perennial,recurring again and again,"Perennial typically describes things that are permanent, constant, or repeated. If you fight with your parents every year over whether they really must invite your annoying cousins for Thanksgiving, you could call that a perennial conflict.","Arguing with your roommate about who cleaned the bathroom last time might be a perennial argument. There is also a perennial plant, which lasts more than two years and usually reappears each spring, because it produces flowers and seeds from the same root structure.

perfidy,an act of deliberate betrayal,"If you shared your most embarrassing secrets with a friend who then told them to everyone he knows, his betrayal could be described as perfidy.","The noun perfidy means ""deceitfulness"" or ""treachery,"" so it's not just being mean, but deliberately betraying a trust.

perfunctory,hasty and without attention to detail; not thorough,"Perfunctory means done as part of a routine or duty. If you give someone a gift and they look at it like it's roadkill and say nothing but a perfunctory ""thank you,"" you might not be giving them another one anytime soon.","A person who does something in a perfunctory way shows little enthusiasm or interest in what they are doing. Many of our everyday greetings are perfunctory. For example, when we say ""Hello"" and ""How are you?"", we usually do so out of habit.

perjury,criminal offense of making false statements under oath,"Perjury is the act of deliberately lying under oath. A defendant in a murder trial commits perjury when he swears he never met the murder victim before, even though he had a two-year relationship with her.","Although the word perjury contains jury, members of the jury aren't likely to commit perjury, because they're not under oath and haven't sworn to be truthful.

pertinent,being of striking appropriateness,"Something pertinent is relevant and on-point. If you give your best friend pertinent advice, that means the advice is appropriate for the situation.","Something pertinent is related to the current topic or situation — and probably helpful too.

It's similar in meaning to the verb ""disturb."" That's right, to perturb is to disturb, but in a way that suggests you're throwing it off its usual path or routine.

peruse,examine or consider with attention and in detail,"Traditionally, peruse has meant to read or examine something carefully.

Pivotal means important, but it has the sense of centrality and turning.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/pivotal

If you have ever heard the plaintive howl of a wolf, then you know what we are getting at here.","A plaint, as in complaint, is an expression of sorrow or grief.

polemic,"a verbal or written attack, especially of a belief or dogma","A polemic is something that stirs up controversy by having a negative opinion, usually aimed at a particular group. A piece of writing can be a polemic, as long as it gets someone's goat.","Polemic comes from the Greek polemikos meaning ""warlike, belligerent."" It's like challenging someone to a duel of ideas. These days a polemic is usually a piece of writing, such as if the Grinch published a powerful polemic against Christmas.

ponderous,having great mass and weight and unwieldiness,"When you call Frankenstein ponderous, it's not because he likes to ponder the great questions of life. It's because he moves like a Mack truck, only slower and less gracefully.","Ponderous also describes a person's manner, or their manner of speaking.

It's hard to say what the legal community would do without the word precedent, since so many legal judgments and decisions are based on what came before.",Lawyers and judges often look for a precedent that can be used as a guide for a similar case. This word is used elsewhere too. Your mom might not let you stay up late because it would set a bad precedent for future bedtimes.

When you called 911 on the guy in your back yard, it was on the premise that he was a thief and not the meter-reader.","In logic, the premise is the basic statement upon whose truth an argument is based. Criticize alternative theories by demonstrating their false premises. In a more general sense, it's a basic assertion. On the premise that people are generally good, you keep your doors unlocked.

If you were a Presidential advisor and you convinced him to make a National Day of Pet Appreciation, then you prevailed upon him to recognize pets.","Prevail can be used for different kinds of success. If you prevail upon someone, you have influence on them. If you prevail over someone, you win. Say you’re a big fan of a losing team.

If your cat had a prodigious litter of kittens, then you've got a houseful of kittens. This is a strong word that's also kind of formal.

A little drizzle isn't a prodigious rain, but a storm that floods a whole city certainly is.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/prodigious
prodigy,an unusually gifted or intelligent person,"A prodigy is someone who is so naturally talented at something that they become a master of that particular skill as a child — you can be a musical prodigy or a math prodigy. Mozart was one, writing symphonies and playing for kings when he was only five years old.","Prodigy is one of those wonderful words whose different meanings tell a story about how the meanings of words bloom over time. The word derives from the Latin prodigium, meaning ""an omen or a sign of something to come.""

profane,grossly irreverent toward what is held to be sacred,"Profane language is the kind that gets bleeped on TV. The word profane can also describe behavior that's deeply offensive because it shows a lack of respect, especially for someone's religious beliefs.","The Latin root profanus means ""unholy,"" and that's where it all started. If you take the Lord's name in vain, you've profaned Him and probably made your religious mom pretty angry too. Don't even try the profane curse words so vital to a truly great hip-hop track but perhaps not recommended for dinner with Grandma.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/profane
profess,"confess one's faith in, or allegiance to","To profess is to declare something, often insincerely. Your joy on the last day of school might lead you to profess that you'll truly miss seeing all the people who annoyed you all year.","You can profess something and mean it, but more often the verb profess is used when someone lies about their true feelings. You might profess your love of your grandmother's tuna casserole, or profess that you never bite your fingernails, but you're just saying what you think people want to hear. The original meaning of profess described taking religious vows, and came from the Latin word professus, meaning ""having declared publicly.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/profess
proficient,having or showing knowledge and skill and aptitude,"When someone has become good at something, they are proficient. After all those hours playing video games, you must be very proficient at them.","Proficient comes from the Latin for making progress, so if someone is proficient, they have made so much progress that they've become good at something. Use proficient to talk about improvement through practice instead of natural ability; even a person with no inherent skill at language can become proficient in Latin. If you're proficient at tennis, you're good, but it doesn't imply the kind of mastery for which the expert is used.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/proficient
profligate,unrestrained by convention or morality,"Profligate, as a noun or as an adjective, implies recklessly wasting your money on extravagant luxury. Profligate behavior is a lot of fun, but you'll regret it later — when you get your charge card bill.","Any time someone behaves in a reckless, amoral, or wasteful way, they are engaging in profligate behavior. It usually refers to financial behavior but can cross over to social activity as well. A person who is a slave to their cravings and whose behavior is unrestrained and selfish can be called a profligate. Extravagantly profligate behavior is often wildly fun but usually comes with a heavy price to pay in the morning, both financially and morally.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/profligate
profound,situated at or extending to great depth,"When you need a word that's deeper than ""deep,"" consider profound. A philosopher is likely to make many profound pronouncements.","Profundus literally means ""deep"" in Latin, and profound had the same meaning when it entered English in the 14th century. But even then, it also meant ""figuratively deep"" — that is, very great or intense: ""The new laws have had a profound impact."" Of people, it means ""very knowledgeable or insightful,"" but sometimes when a person tries to sound profound, they're really just giving you superficial knowledge dressed up with big words.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/profound
profuse,produced or growing in extreme abundance,Profuse is a word for a lot of something or even way too much — a profuse rainfall is a serious amount of rain.,"This word has to do with extravagance or abundance. If you're bleeding profusely, you're bleeding a lot. If you lavish profuse gifts on your pet, you might have too much money on your hands. When you give someone profuse praise, you're probably laying it on a little thick. If you’re a farmer and your crops are profuse, that’s great because you have a lot of crops. Anything profuse is happening in great amounts.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/profuse
proletariat,a social class comprising those who do manual labor,"Proletariat is an old term for the working class. It was commonly used by Marxists and other people who believed that capitalism had created a class of workers who were exploited by company owners. They called those owners ""the bourgeoisie.""","When you use the word proletariat now, your audience might assume that you've arrived in a time machine from the 19th century and you're still angry about the exploitation of workers. So you probably would use the term self-consciously or humorously, as in “The boss just sent around a memo saying no one’s allowed to leave until we’ve finished compiling the report. I guess the proletariat had better forget about making it home in time to watch the kick-off.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/proletariat
proliferate,grow rapidly,"When something proliferates, it's growing, spreading or multiplying really quickly. Bunny rabbits have a habit of proliferating, as do dandelions in untended gardens and funny YouTube videos on the internet.","Proliferate was originally a biological term used to describe the growth of cells and producing offspring. It wasn’t until 1961 that we started to use proliferate more generally to talk about everything from the spread of nuclear weapons to the wide growth of Walmart. Other similar words include expand, reproduce, snowball, and spawn.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/proliferate
prolific,intellectually productive,Someone or something that is prolific is fruitful or highly productive. A prolific songwriter can churn out five hit tunes before breakfast.,"A prolific writer cranks out two novels a year, and a prolific rabbit has baby bunnies every few months.

It can also connote something taking root and growing, like prolific poison ivy that takes over the yard.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/prolific
promulgate,state or announce,To promulgate is to officially put a law into effect. Your state may announce a plan to promulgate a new traffic law on January 1st.,"Laws aren't the only things you can promulgate. The word promulgate comes from the Latin word promulgatus, meaning ""make publicly known.""

Dogs have a propensity to bark, and many people have a propensity for getting annoyed by it.","If you have a propensity for something, then it's something that comes naturally to you or something you just do a lot. Some people have a propensity to laugh. Other people have a propensity for making others laugh, or for being generous, or for getting angry. It's hard to change your propensities. Sometimes a propensity is a bad thing, as in a criminal with a propensity for theft or murder.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/propensity
propitious,presenting favorable circumstances,"When the timing of something is propitious, it's likely to turn out well. A propitious time for taking a big test is when you've studied hard and had a good night's sleep.","If you believe in astrology, you might check your horoscope to settle on a propitious day for your wedding. A propitious moment to ask your parents about that spring break trip to Cancun might be when you've just unveiled your straight-A report card.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/propitious
proponent,a person who pleads for a cause or propounds an idea,"Proponent means someone who is in favor of something. You might be a proponent of longer vacations, but your parents are proponents of a longer school year.","If you’re in favor of long school vacations, you’re pro or ""for"" long vacations. The prefix pro- also carries the meaning of “forward,” “ahead,” or “before.” All of these senses are at work in proponent: someone who suggests (puts forward) an idea or who is in favor of an idea. A proponent proposes an idea or advocates for a proposal or a proposition.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/proponent
proprietary,protected by trademark or patent or copyright,"If you own something, especially something of value, then you have proprietary rights.

Years ago, owners of small mom-and-pop stores were known as proprietors.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/proprietary
prosaic,lacking wit or imagination,"Prosaic means ordinary or dull.

Prose is often contrasted with poetry, which usually has a more imaginative and original style.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/prosaic
proscribe,command against,"To proscribe something is to forbid or prohibit it, as a school principal might proscribe the use of cell phones in class.","Proscribe sounds similar to the word prescribe, but be careful: these words are essentially opposite in meaning. While proscribe means forbid, prescribe is used when a doctor recommends a medicine or remedy. Of course, if you want an excuse for not following your doctor’s orders, you could say you were confused about the meaning of these two words — but that would be lying, which is proscribed by most people’s value systems. And it would also be bad for your health.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/proscribe

If you are going to proselytize, try not to be too pushy!","The word proselytize can specifically refer to religious evangelism, as in: ""Proselytizing is a fundamental component of Mormonism.""

protagonist,the principal character in a work of fiction,A protagonist is the central character in a story: the protagonist of Huckleberry Finn is — guess who? — Huckleberry Finn.,"A novel, movie, or play might have many main characters, but it can really only have one protagonist — or maybe two in the case of, say, Romeo and Juliet. That's because protos means ""first"" in Greek, and agonistes means ""competitor"" or ""actor."" It can also mean a leading figure in a real-life situation: ""Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis were the protagonists of the U.S. Civil War."" Don't use it to mean ""a supporter of an idea or cause""; the word you're looking for in that situation is proponent.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/protagonist
protract,lengthen in time; cause to be or last longer,"To protract something is to stretch it out. If you have a disagreement with a friend that you continue for weeks and weeks, you are protracting the argument.","Protract can also mean to draw a plan to scale.

A protractor allows you to protract a plan for the perfect catapult — perfect to use to end a protracted battle.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/protract
provident,giving something useful for the future,"If you are provident, that means you plan carefully for the future. You have your Christmas lights up in early December, you have a well-stocked pantry, and you have some savings tucked away just in case.","The word provident traces back to the Latin word providere, meaning ""foresee, provide."" The word can be used to describe someone who looks into the future — foresees the future, in a sense — and makes decisions based on future needs.

provincial,associated with an administrative district of a nation,"A provincial person comes from the backwaters. Someone from a small province outside of Provence, France, might seem a little more provincial and less worldly than someone from, say, Paris.","Something or someone provincial belongs to a province, or region outside of the city. Provincial has a straightforward meaning when describing where someone is from, but it has some other shades of meaning too. Something provincial can be quaint and in a pleasing rural or country style, but it also can imply someone less sophisticated, as in someone with provincial, or simple, tastes. Individuals or groups of people who are considered narrow-minded are often labeled provincial, even if they're from the city.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/provincial
provisional,under terms not final or fully worked out or agreed upon,"Something provisional is temporary, in the sense that it's only valid for a while. You'll often hear provisional used to describe things such as governments, elections, contracts, and agreements, all of which can change into something permanent.","People who go camping take provisions, which means supplies for the trip. This can be helpful when you're trying to use provisional properly. Remember that those provisions are, well, provisional—they're only supposed to last until the campers get home, where the real food is waiting. If you're in a rush to start filming, you might consider giving your star a provisional contract, so that you can at least get started. You'll have time to replace the provisional one with a permanent one while you film.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/provisional

prudent,marked by sound judgment,"Describe an action as prudent if it is the wise thing to do under the existing circumstances. If you're getting in trouble, it is probably prudent to keep your mouth closed and just listen.","If you show good and careful judgment when handling practical matters, you can be described as prudent. Similarly, a wise and well-thought-through decision or action can be called prudent. The word comes from a contracted form of the Latin prōvidēns, from the verb ""to foresee.""

purportedly,believed or reputed to be the case,"If something purportedly happened, it may or may not have actually occurred. If your brother purportedly knows nothing about the cookies you left on the kitchen counter, it means he claims to be innocent of cookie theft. Whether or not you believe him, well, that's another story...","When you use purportedly it means you only know what you've been told, or what appears to be the case, not necessarily what the entire truth is. A dog that purportedly doesn't bite is still scary when it's barking at you. And although your friend is purportedly only joking when she says she hates your haircut, it may still hurt your feelings. You can also use the synonyms ""supposedly"" or ""allegedly.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/purportedly
putative,purported,"You might be the putative leader of your lacrosse team, even if someone else holds the title of captain. Putative means to be known as something by reputation, or assumed to be something, or generally accepted.","Every once in a while, a putative planet is reported in the news, which we get very excited about and which usually turns out to be an illusion. But in 2005, an astronomer discovered what appears to be a new planet beyond Neptune. But is this putative planet for real? There is always some doubt — something not quite official — about putative things.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/putative
qualify,add a modifier to a constituent,"Make sure you know the context when using the word qualify. In one sense, it means to be right for, to measure up. In another sense, though, qualify means to change something slightly, to limit it or add a condition to it.","If you want to qualify for your driver's license, remember not to drive through that final stop sign without stopping. I guarantee you that if you don't stop you will not qualify. You don't just get your Eagle Badge. You have to qualify for it—there's a lot to do before you get it. The word might be used in its other sense like this: If you plan to get married, keep your vows simple: say ""I do."" Don't qualify them by saying something like ""I do...except sometimes, when I don't."" If you have to qualify your wedding vows, don't get married.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/qualify
qualitative,relating to or involving comparisons based on degrees,"Anything that's qualitative has to do with the characteristics or features of something, rather than its quantity. If you prefer A Wrinkle in Time to another book with the same number of pages, that's a qualitative preference.","Qualitative shows up in scientific writing to clarify that the quality of something is being assessed, not its size or quantity. Scientists often contrast qualitative analysis or data with quantitative facts, information that can actually be measured. Qualitative properties of your house include its coziness and its cheerful color scheme. Among its quantitative aspects are its monetary value and its precise square footage.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/qualitative
querulous,habitually complaining,"Querulous means “having a tendency to complain” or, more directly put, “whiny.” Sure, no one can be happy all the time, but that’s no excuse for being querulous.","Querulous may remind you of the word query, which means “question.” However, the two words are not closely related. It’s perfectly reasonable to make a query; just don’t be querulous if you don’t like the answer you get. Querulous does share its origins with the word quarrel, which means “argument” — and that’s what’s likely to happen if you complain too much.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/querulous
quixotic,not sensible about practical matters,"Use quixotic for someone or something that is romantic and unrealistic, or possessed by almost impossible hopes. Your quixotic task is easy to understand, if difficult to achieve: establish world peace.","What a wonderful word quixotic is! While it is most often used to mean equally impractical and idealistic, it also has the sense of romantic nobility. Its source is from the great Spanish novel ""Don Quixote,"" whose title character is given to unrealistic schemes and great chivalry.

ramification,"a consequence, especially one that causes complications","A ramification is an accidental consequence that complicates things. Remember that time you borrowed your father's car without asking? The ramification was that Dad missed an important meeting, his company went under, and he had to sell the car. Oops!","The ramifications are the broader effects that fan out into the world from one situation, or decision, that kicks it all off. Ramification also refers to something branching out, like limbs on a tree — which is what bad decisions tend to do. Ramification is like consequence, but usually unintended and bad. The word is often used in political discussions about laws or government decisions because they might be made locally but could affect people worldwide.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ramification
rancor,a feeling of deep and bitter anger and ill-will,"The word rancor is best when you're not just talking about anger, you're talking about a deep, twisted bitter type of anger in your heart. The open rancor in political discussion prevents cooperation between political parties.","The most helpful way to remember rancor with all its dark, miserable bitterness is to think of how rancor rhymes with canker, as in canker sore, the horrible painful burning on your lip. Or, you might want to remind yourself that rancor has its roots in the word rancid meaning ""rotten."" Rancor refers particularly to the sort of ill-will associated with resentment, envy, slow-brewing anger, and a very personal sort of hatred.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/rancor
rapacious,excessively greedy and grasping,"Something rapacious is out to devour — anything, and little can stand in its way. A rapacious landlord is out for more rent, and a rapacious eater is only satisfied at the all-you-can-eat buffet.","A 17th-century word, from the Latin rapere, ""to snatch,"" rapacious originally described the people and animals who often preyed on weaker creatures and devoured them, by eating them or by ruining them through some scandal.

rebuke,an act or expression of criticism and censure,"If you receive a rebuke, it means that you have been reprimanded, or scolded. You're sure to get a rebuke if you forget to do your math homework four days in a row.","The word rebuke can be a verb, meaning to sternly reprimand or scold, but it can also be a noun, because a rebuke is the result of being scolded. The root comes from the Old French rebuchier and means ""to hack down,"" or ""beat back."" A rebuke, then, is meant to be critical and to chide — in today's terms, a rebuke is verbal smack-down!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/rebuke
rebut,"overthrow by argument, evidence, or proof","To rebut is to argue against something. If your parents say you're too young and irresponsible to drive, you can rebut their claim by ticking off examples of your responsibility.","When you argue against something, you rebut that position or argument. Your school's principal might rebut your teacher's argument that the class is overcrowded by pointing out that there could legally be five more kids in the class.

recant,formally reject or disavow a formerly held belief,"If you're someone who speaks before you think, you may need to recant, or take back, that overly honest assessment of your friend's new haircut.","Recant comes from two Latin roots: the prefix re-, meaning ""back,"" and the verb cantare, meaning ""to sing."" It has been suggested that recant was first used when someone reversed a charm, curse, or some other type of magical spell that would have been chanted or sung. Regardless of whether this is true or not, we suggest that you refrain from singing when you need to recant — unless you've been casting nasty spells on people.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/recant
reciprocal,concerning each of two or more persons or things,"Reciprocal describes something that's the same on both sides. If you and your sister are in a big fight on a long car trip, you might resolve it through a reciprocal agreement that you'll stop poking her and she'll stop reading road signs out loud.","The word mutual is a near synonym in most uses: reciprocal/mutual friendship, describing, a relationship in which two people feel the same way about each other, or do or give similar things to each other.

Grocery shopping late at night is a reclusive habit, because few people are in the store then.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/reclusive
recondite,difficult to understand,"It's rather difficult to penetrate the meaning of recondite. Fitting, because it's an adjective that basically means hard for the average mind to understand.","If it's really hard to comprehend, then it's safe to say it's recondite. In the same family as ""abstruse,"" ""esoteric"" and ""totally deep, man,"" recondite is a very serious word that you could use to describe obscure philosophy books, high level mathematical theory, and the series finale of The Sopranos — you know, things that make your brain hurt.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/recondite
recrimination,mutual accusations,"Sometimes you accuse your opponent of refusing to compromise and he accuses you of the same thing. That’s a recrimination, an accusation or insult that’s hurled back at someone.","If you’ve ever been in a verbal disagreement with someone, odds are that you’ve experienced recriminations. You can remember it by noticing that crim as in ""crime"" is part of the word. When recriminations fly back and forth between two sides, each accuses the other of crimes in the metaphorical sense. Once the emergencies of a disaster have been taken care of, recriminations are sometimes hurled at those in charge for the way the crisis was handled.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/recrimination

He had a shifty eye redolent of years of lying and petty crime.","People used to use redolent of something with a strong, distinctive odor. Now, think of it as ""stinks of"" — but in a fancy way.

redundant,"more than is needed, desired, or required",The word redundant applies to things that are unnecessary or could be left out. Calling a blank sheet of paper empty is redundant.,"Teachers often tell students to avoid being redundant — meaning avoid saying something twice or more. Have you ever heard someone tell a story and repeat the same thing over and over? The repeated parts are redundant. Sometimes being redundant can make things clear, but it can also be annoying. Redundant can apply to anything that's overflowing or unnecessary. If a business has two stores on the same street, one is redundant. When you hear redundant, think ""Too much!""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/redundant
refute,"overthrow by argument, evidence, or proof","The verb refute is to prove that something is wrong. When the kids you're babysitting swear they brushed their teeth, you can refute their claim by presenting the dry toothbrushes.","Evidence and arguments are used to refute something. So are facts. For example, if children who eat chocolate before going to bed go straight to sleep, that refutes the idea that sugar keeps them up. Refute comes from the Latin refutare for ""to check, suppress."" A near synonym is confute, but save refute as an everyday word for proving something is false.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/refute
reiterate,"say, state, or perform again","To reiterate something is to say or do something again, or many times. Let me reiterate: if you repeat yourself, you're reiterating the thing you originally said.","This verb is from Middle English reiteraten, from Latin reiteratus, from reiterare ""to repeat,"" from the prefix re- ""again"" plus iterare ""to repeat, iterate.""

relentless,never-ceasing,"Relentless is a good word for describing something that's harsh, unforgiving, and persistent, like the hot sun in the desert, or a cold that keeps you in bed for days with a nose like a strawberry.","When you're relentless about something, you mean business. You're not stopping until you get what you want, and you're not taking ""no"" for an answer. People might try to steer you from your goal, but you have eyes only for the prize and they're just going to have to get out of your way.

She might call it remonstrating. Either way, it's embarrassing.","Remonstrate has its roots in a Latin verb meaning ""to show,"" and it used to mean ""to make plain.""

renounce,turn away from; give up,"To renounce is to officially give up or turn away from. If you decide to become a vegetarian, you will renounce hamburgers and bacon.","The transitive verb renounce is a stronger, more formal way of saying that you reject or disown something. A prince who's tired of the royal life could renounce his title and become a commoner, and a senator who wanted to become an independent would have to renounce her ties to her previous political party. You'd be wise to heed the wisdom of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who said: “To renounce liberty is to renounce being a man, to surrender the rights of humanity and even its duties.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/renounce
reparation,something done or paid in expiation of a wrong,"If you guessed that reparation is related to the word repair, you were right. Both come from the Latin word meaning ""to restore."" While reparation has a range of meanings, they all convey the sense of fixing or making up for a past wrong.","In contemporary usage, the plural form is more common than the singular. Victims of a crime, for example, may receive reparations from the perpetrators. A defeated nation may be forced to pay reparations to its victorious enemies. Many have suggested that the United States government should provide reparations to the descendants of slaves. The word almost always has legal or political connotations, and it conveys the sense of restitution — often expressed in money — for wrongdoing.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/reparation
repercussion,a remote or indirect consequence of some action,"A repercussion is something that happens because of another action. You could quit paying your rent, but getting evicted from your apartment might be the repercussion.","Repercussion may remind you slightly of concussion or percussion — what they all have in common is the idea of something (a head, a drum) getting hit. With repercussion, the hitting is the action, and the result (i.e., the repercussion) is like hearing an echo of that original strike over and over as it reverberates through the air.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/repercussion
replenish,fill something that had previously been emptied,"To replenish something is to refill it. If you have a pet pooch, you’re probably obligated to replenish his food bowl to avoid being barked at incessantly.","Use replenish when talking about something valuable or desirable, such as money or food. For example, you might discuss replenishing your bank account, but you wouldn’t speak of replenishing a trash can. You can also use replenish in a joking way to show that something is of value to you; by noting that the jar of jellybeans on your desk needs to be replenished, you indicate that you require jellybeans to survive your day at the office. We get that.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/replenish
replete,deeply filled or permeated,"Replete means full, often in a satisfying way. ""The library was replete with bound first editions, and Lucy, a bookworm, was happier there than any place else.""","Replete shares a root with the word plenty.

When you unpack your groceries, your pantry is replete with essentials.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/replete
reprehensible,bringing or deserving severe rebuke or censure,"Reprehensible means deserving of blame or strong criticism.

reprisal,a retaliatory action against an enemy in wartime,"A reprisal is an act of retaliation, especially one committed by one country against another. If you attack your enemy's village and cause lots of damage, expect a reprisal.","Reprisal comes from the French for taking back, and used to mean the seizure of property as a compensation for some earlier loss. Now we use it more in the sense of a retaliatory attack. When Germany bombed London during World War II, the British reprisals included the bombing of Berlin. Reprisal doesn't always have to be about war; you can use it for any act of retaliation.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/reprisal
reproach,express criticism towards,"Reproach means to mildly criticize. If you show poor manners at your grandmother's dinner table, she will reproach you.","The verb reproach means to express disapproval or criticism of; as a noun it means blame or criticism.

reprove,"reprimand, scold, or express dissatisfaction with","If you get into trouble and are sent to the principal’s office, be prepared for the principal to reprove you for your behavior. To reprove is to scold, reprimand, or — in plain English — “chew out.”","Reprove is a verb used in the same way as “scold,” or “dress down.” To reprove is to express your dissatisfaction or disapproval with something. It’s a less severe word than denounce or decry. It is closer to the verb criticize. Your parents might reprove you for a minor offense like not cleaning your room or chewing with your mouth open. And, for the record, reprove is not the root word prove with the prefix re- as if to mean “prove again.” If you use it that way, someone would likely reprove you.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/reprove
repudiate,"reject as untrue, unfounded, or unjust","To repudiate something is to reject it, or to refuse to accept or support it. If you grow up religious, but repudiate all organized religion as an adult, you might start spending holidays at the movies, or just going to work.","This verb usually refers to rejecting something that has authority, such as a legal contract, doctrine, or claim. In connection with debts or other obligations, repudiate is used in the specialized sense ""to refuse to recognize or pay.""

From the way Milo said ""I shall,"" we can infer that he was quite confident in his split-second decision, or at least made himself appear to be so.

If you make a ""resolute refusal"" of something, you're declaring you don't like it and never will.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/resolute
respite,a pause from doing something,"A respite is a break from something that's difficult or unpleasant. If you're cramming for exams, take an occasional walk to give yourself a respite from the intensity.","Respite may look like it rhymes with despite, but this word has a stress on its first syllable (RES-pit). It comes from the Latin word respectus, meaning refuge, but we almost always use respite to describe a time, not a place, of relief. If you've been fighting with your partner, a visit from a friend might offer a brief respite from the argument, but the fight will pick up again when she leaves.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/respite
revere,regard with feelings of respect,"Revere means to respect someone so deeply that you almost worship them. Many Americans revere civil rights activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks, who worked to make the country a more just place.","Revere is related to the words reverence (""to hold something in worshipful awe"") and its opposite — irreverent. Reverence for the irreverent is actually possible. Howard Stern humor is often vulgar and absurdly irreverent yet his legions of fans and even some media analysts revere him and his ability to maintain a loyal audience. Revere is the perfect word when respect is not strong enough but worship seems a little too religious-sounding. Rock stars, for example, are revered by throngs of devoted fans.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/revere
rhetoric,study of the technique for using language effectively,"Rhetoric is speaking or writing that's intended to persuade. If your goal is to write editorial columns for the New York Times, you should work on your rhetoric.","Rhetoric comes from the Greek meaning ""speaker"" and is used for the art of persuasive speaking or writing. When people listened eagerly to long speeches and studied them in school, rhetoric was generally used positively; now it is often a negative term, implying artfulness over real content. If someone gives a clever speech but doesn't really address the problem, you might say, ""That's just a lot of rhetoric.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/rhetoric
rigorous,rigidly accurate; allowing no deviation from a standard,"If you are rigorous when you do something, you do it extremely carefully and precisely. A rigorous inspection of your tax records has revealed the government owes you money. Congratulations!","The Latin root for rigorous is rigor, meaning “stiffness.” This might remind you of rigor mortis, the stiffening of a body after death, as often seen on cop shows. This is a good, if creepy, way of remembering the meaning of rigorous: rigorous people are stiff and unbending about the standards of their work. This requires being alive, of course.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/rigorous
robust,"sturdy and strong in form, constitution, or construction","Use robust to describe a person or thing that is healthy and strong, or strongly built.

rogue,a deceitful and unreliable scoundrel,"A rogue is a sneaky person who has tricks up his sleeve, not like a magician, but like someone who would steal your wallet or cheat at cards.","Dishonesty won’t get you far in life, unless you are a rogue who survives by lying and exploiting others. The word comes from the Latin rogare, which means “beg,” and while some rogues dress like beggars to get your money, anyone who deceives is a rogue, like the presidents of corrupt corporations who steal from their employees, or that rogue Uncle Marvin who promises you chocolate for washing his car, but afterward tells you he has no chocolate. That rogue!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/rogue
rudimentary,being in the earliest stages of development,"Rudimentary means basic, or at a very early stage. The test should be easy: it requires only a rudimentary understanding of the materials.","The word rude means simple or offensive — and people with only rudimentary understanding of good manners might not know how that belching is rude.

ruminate,reflect deeply on a subject,"When you ruminate, it means you are thinking very deeply about something. You're likely to be so lost in thought that you stare off into space and don't hear people when they call your name.","Another meaning of ruminate is to ""chew the cud,"" which can mean ""to turn it over and over in your mind.""

Whether you're a human or a cow, if you ruminate, it will take a LONG time.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ruminate
rustic,characteristic of rural life,"When you think of the word rustic, think of the rural country. This word can be given a positive or a negative spin depending on how you use it; a rustic inn, for example, might be quaint or it might be virtually uninhabitable.","The words rustic and ""rural"" spring from the same ancient root: *rur-, which means ""open space"" in the hypothetical ancestor language Proto-Indo-European. In early usage, these two words were used interchangeably, but now, rural is used to describe locations –- ""rural community,"" ""rural location"" — while rustic refers to the unrefined qualities associated with country life. The best antonym is cosmopolitan, which implies the sophistication and worldliness of city life.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/rustic
saccharine,overly sweet,"You might be tempted to turn the radio dial when you hear a love song that is saccharine, meaning that it’s too sweet and sentimental to bear.",The adjective saccharine comes from the Middle Latin word for sugar. Saccharine is a type of sugar substitute that you might sprinkle on your cereal or berries to sweeten them without the calories of real sugar. The word is used to describe something so sweet that it’s annoying — like a very sentimental song or a tear-jerking commercial.,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/saccharine
sacrilege,blasphemous behavior,"If you show up to an animal rights rally with a bucket full of fried chicken for lunch, you may be accused of committing sacrilege. You are violating a belief held sacred, at least by some individuals.","Sacrilege has its roots in the Latin sacr-, meaning ""holy."" Sacrilege was originally reserved for talking about blasphemous acts that disrespect, violate, or misuse holy traditions or objects. However, today the term sacrilege carries a broader, and lighter, meaning than its origins suggest. For example, it's usually considered sacrilege to root for the out-of-town team that's playing against your home team. Ancient users of this word might think our looser definition is sacrilege.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/sacrilege
sacrosanct,treated as if holy and kept free from violation or criticism,You might be enraged at the idea of doing homework on a Saturday if you consider your weekends sacrosanct — meaning they are too special or important to interrupt.,"Sacrosanct is often used to describe religious rituals and traditions, which isn’t surprising considering that this adjective comes from the Latin word for something that is protected by a religious sanction. A church, for example, might consider its Sunday service to be sacrosanct — a very important and holy ritual that cannot be changed or canceled. It’s a bad idea to criticize or change any custom or tradition that people consider sacrosanct — they won’t be happy about it.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/sacrosanct
sagacious,acutely insightful and wise,Use the formal adjective sagacious to describe someone who is wise and insightful like an advisor to the president or a Supreme Court justice.,"Someone like an inspirational leader or an expert in a field who seeks knowledge and has foresight can be described as sagacious.

salient,"conspicuous, prominent, or important","If something stands out in a very obvious way, it can be called salient. It's time to find new friends if the differences between you and your current friends are becoming more and more salient.","Salient, from the Latin verb salire ""to leap,"" was originally used in English to refer to leaping animals such as a frog or deer and may still be used this way.

When giving an argument, make your most salient points at the beginning or the end.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/salient
salutary,tending to promote physical well-being; beneficial to health,"Use salutary to describe something that's good for your health, like the salutary benefits of exercise, laughter, and getting enough sleep every night.","When you look at the word salutary, you might expect it to have something to do with showing respect to military personnel, perhaps by saluting. In fact, salutary and salute do share a Latin root: salus, which means ""good health."" When you salute someone, or say ""Salud!"" before clinking glasses and taking a first sip, you're essentially giving your salutary wish — in other words, hoping a person enjoys good health.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/salutary
sanctimonious,excessively or hypocritically pious,"The sanctimonious person sounds like a hypocrite when he preaches to a friend about the evils of drugs, while he drinks one beer after another.","Sanctimonious is a twist on the words sanctity and sacred, which mean holy or religious. A sanctimonious person might think he's holy, but their attitude comes across more like ""holier-than-thou."" Though sanctimonious people might try to act like saints, their actions are far from pure or holy, which just makes them sound like hypocrites.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/sanctimonious
sanguine,confidently optimistic and cheerful,"If you're sanguine about a situation, that means you're optimistic that everything's going to work out fine.","Sanguine is from Latin sanguis ""blood"" and originally meant ""bloody"" — in medieval medicine it described someone whose ruddy complexion was a sign of an optimistic outlook. That was back when people thought that ""bodily humors"" like blood were responsible for your attitudes. Now that we no longer believe in humors, sanguine has settled down as a fancy way to say someone is cheerfully confident. Experts are frequently described as feeling sanguine about a political or economic situation — or not sanguine, if they think we're going to hell in a handbasket.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/sanguine
sardonic,disdainfully or ironically humorous,"If someone is being scornful and mocking in a humorous way, call her sardonic. If you want to write comic sketches for late-night talk shows, work on being sardonic.","Sardonic comes from the Greek adjective Sardonios, which actually describes a plant from a place called Sardinia that supposedly made your face contort into a horrible grin...right before you died from its poison.

scintillate,emit or reflect light in a flickering manner,"The verb scintillate means to twinkle or glow, as in a flickering light. You may find it romantic to sit on the deck overlooking a lake on a clear night, where you can enjoy the scintillating stars in the sky and the reflection of the moon on the water.","Scintillate means to be sparkling and lively. Scintillate has its roots in the Latin words scintillare, meaning ""to sparkle,"" and scintilla, meaning ""a spark.""

A near synonym is punctilious.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/scrupulous
scrutinize,examine carefully for accuracy,"If you want to examine something closely and go over every single detail, then you should scrutinize it. Like the way your mom probably assesses your outfit before you leave the house for school.","Scrutinizing is very different from glancing or gazing. It's even more than a long, hard look. To scrutinize something, you have to look at it really critically, investigating every nook and cranny. Often things are scrutinized to verify if they're correct or authentic. So it makes perfect sense that this verb is rooted in the Latin word scrutari, which means “to search.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/scrutinize
secular,someone who is not a clergyman or a professional person,Secular things are not religious. Anything not affiliated with a church or faith can be called secular.,"Non-religious people can be called atheists or agnostics, but to describe things, activities, or attitudes that have nothing to do with religion, you can use the word secular.

It's what the southern states did at the start of the Civil War.,"Sedition is the rebellious talk and encouragement that might lead to a mutiny, and can be charged as a crime, like treason. The Alien and Sedition Acts passed into law in the late 1700s were challenged by none other than Thomas Jefferson as a violation of Americans' First Amendment rights to free speech. The Sedition Act quietly expired a few years later but was essentially replaced in the early 1900s by what is called the Espionage Act, which was later repealed as well. Proving sedition can become a murky business: when should the expression of one's activism be considered free speech and when should it be considered sedition?",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/sedition
segregate,divide from the main body or mass and collect,"To separate people by race or religion is to segregate them. In general, the word segregate means to separate one type of thing from another.","In the United States, the practice of segregating blacks from whites in public schools and public places was common in the South until the 1960s. Because of this, people don't even like to use the word segregate in its neutral sense. But you could rightly say that new bicycle lanes are designed to segregate bikes from auto traffic.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/segregate
sensory,relating to or concerned in sensation,"The adjective sensory describes something relating to sensation — something that you feel with your physical senses. Sticking a knife into a toaster will give you a sensory experience, but so will smelling a rose. Stick with the rose.","Sensory comes from the Latin word sentire, meaning ""to perceive, feel."" Sampling your mom's blueberry pie is a sensory experience — you can smell it, you can taste it, and the crust has a really good texture. You may get sensory overload when you're in New York City because there's so much for your senses to take in. Sensory can also describe a nerve fiber, such as a sensory neuron, that carries impulses to the nerve centers in your body.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/sensory

sequester,keep away from others,"The word sequester describes being kept away from others. If your sister tells you to stay out of the way so she can cook dinner for her new boyfriend, you might sequester yourself in your room.","Legal types may be familiar with the word sequester since it’s often used in relation to a jury for an important trial. In that case, members of the jury are sequestered, meaning they aren't allowed to watch the news or read articles that could influence their judgment. However, sequester can describe anyone who is isolated or hidden away from others, like a pop star sequestered in a hotel room, protected from fans' mania below.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/sequester
serendipity,good luck in making unexpected and fortunate discoveries,"If you find good things without looking for them, serendipity — unexpected good luck — has brought them to you.","Serendipity does not come from Latin or Greek, but rather was created by a British nobleman in the mid 1700s from an ancient Persian fairy tale.

servile,submissive or fawning in attitude or behavior,"If you want to get someone to like you, don't offer to fetch them a Coke, rub their feet, or do their homework. They won't like you any better, and your servile attitude will only cost you their respect.","To remember servile, just think of the word servant––they both derive from the Latin servus ""slave.""

A singular opportunity to sing onstage with a rock star is a remarkable opportunity.","Seeing the single inside singular can help you understand its meaning in the sense of one. In grammar, singular means one, as opposed to plural, which means more than one. But singular’s not always––or singularly––about being unique. Walking through a foggy cemetery might give you a singular feeling––or a feeling that’s odd and peculiar––that ghosts could possibly be real.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/singular
sinister,"wicked, evil, or dishonorable","People who are left-handed might feel unlucky having to use a desk designed for right-handers, but there probably wasn't any sinister, or evil, intent behind the design. Or was there?","In the 15th century, when the word sinister came into use in English, people who were left-handed were thought to be bad luck or even evil. In his play Hamlet, Shakespeare wrote of the villain holding a human skull in his sinister — i.e., left — hand.

solicitous,full of anxiety and concern,"When you hear the word solicitous, think of your mom — attentive, caring, and concerned. It's nice when your waiter gives you good service, but if he or she is solicitous, the hovering might annoy you.","Solicitous comes from the Latin roots sollus ""entire"" and citus ""set in motion."" If someone is solicitous, they are entirely set in motion caring for you. Your neighbors are solicitous if they try to help your family out all the time.

As a noun, solvent is either a certain kind of chemical or an idea that solves a problem. As an adjective, solvent describes someone who's got cash on hand.","A solvent dissolves other chemicals, which is why it's also easy to remember: solvent is a chemical used to dissolve other chemicals. The adjective solvent, on the other hand, comes from a French verb that means ""loosen.""

The mail carrier comes every day but the plumber's visits are sporadic––he comes as needed.","A specialized use of sporadic is to describe a disease that appears only occasionally in random cases, and is therefore not an epidemic. English borrowed the word sporadic from Greek sporadikós ""scattered."" A very near synonym is intermittent.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/sporadic
spurious,plausible but false,"Something false or inauthentic is spurious. Don't trust spurious ideas and stories. Spurious statements often are lies, just as a spurious coin is a counterfeit coin — a fake.","Anytime you see the word spurious, you're dealing with things that can't be trusted or accepted at face value. A spurious claim is one that's not backed up by the facts. A spurious argument relies on faulty reasoning — and maybe some lies.

stagnation,a state of inactivity,"Stagnation is the state of being still, or not moving, like a sitting puddle of water where stagnation attracts mosquitoes.","The root of stagnation is the Latin word for ""standing water,"" stagnatum.

You might want to go to that concert Friday night, but your parents' staunch opposition prevents you.","Staunch is sometimes used as a verb to mean ""to stop the flow of a liquid,"" but most usage books will tell you it's better to use the word stanch for the verb. Think of a soldier stopping and standing still, and you will understand the connection between the two meanings. The adjectival form should make you think of ""stand,"" as in “stand firm,” or ""take a stand."" It comes from the French estanche meaning “watertight” and the Latin stanticare, which is probably from stans for “stand.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/staunch
steadfast,marked by firm determination or resolution; not shakable,"Someone who is firm and determined in a belief or a position can be called steadfast in that view, like your mom when she thinks you really shouldn’t wear that outfit.","The word steadfast traces back to the Old English word stedefæst, a combination of stede, meaning ""place,"" and fæst, meaning ""firmly fixed."" Picture a steadfast person standing firmly in place, not wavering or budging an inch, and you’ll have a good sense of what this word means.

The years leading up to the U.S. Civil War were characterized by great strife between northern and southern states over slavery and the role of a federal government.,"This word applies to major issues and events, such as war and religious conflict: a period of civil strife.

subordinate,an assistant subject to the authority or control of another,"A subordinate is someone who works for someone else. As a verb, to subordinate means to place or rank one thing below another. When you're doing a group project, sometimes you have to subordinate your ideas to the desires of the larger group.","The prefix sub- means ""lower"" and ordinate refers to an ordering of things. In the army, a private is subordinate to an officer. You can also say the private is a subordinate. When it's an adjective or noun, the word is pronounced ""suh-BOR-duh-nit.""

subtle,difficult to detect or grasp by the mind or analyze,Something that is subtle is not obvious: a professional food taster might be able to perceive subtle differences of flavor that most people don't notice.,"Subtle is used for things that are hard to describe because of their complexity or delicacy: a way of thinking, arguing, or creating a work of art. The word is pronounced like ""suttle"" and it was originally spelled that way when it was borrowed from Old French, but the b got imported to make the word look more like its ultimate source, the Latin adjective subtilis. If you try to pronounce the b, your ignorance of how to say the word properly won't be very subtle!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/subtle
subversive,in opposition to an established system or government,"You might want to call someone subversive if they are sneakily trying to undermine something, from the social structure of your high school to an entire system of government.","You can use subversive as a noun or an adjective without changing it one whit. Note the prefix sub, meaning ""underneath,"" with the remainder coming from the Latin vertere, ""to turn.""

supercilious,having or showing arrogant disdain or haughtiness,"Supercilious people think very highly of themselves, more highly than of others.

But one-on-one, your famous physics professor might be humble and fun to talk to, anything but supercilious. Most often, it's people who have no right to be arrogant, rude, and holier-than-thou who behave in the most supercilious ways.

superficial,"of, affecting, or being on or near the surface","Anything superficial has to do with the surface of something. If you're judging a book by its cover, you're being superficial. People who worry too much about their clothes and hair may also be considered superficial.","The word superficial has to do with appearances and the surface. If a car is in an accident, but it only has a few scratches, you could say it has superficial damage, because the important parts are OK. If you just glance at a movie for a second, your opinion will be more superficial than the opinion of someone who watched the whole film closely.

superfluous,"more than is needed, desired, or required","When something is so unnecessary that it could easily be done away with, like a fifth wheel on a car or a fifth person on a double date, call it superfluous.","Superfluous (soo-PER-floo-uhs) means ""more than required."" Use it when pointing out something that could be removed without detracting from the quality of something: ""For a climb over a glacier, the very thickest shoes are absolutely necessary; beyond these, all else seems superfluous to me,"" wrote the adventurer Charles Stoddard in 1899.

surfeit,indulge (one's appetite) to satiety,"Steve baked a surfeit of jam tarts. Steve ate a surfeit of jam tarts. Steve surfeited himself on jam tarts.

When it is used in reference to food or eating, surfeit tends to suggest indulging to the point of sickness or disgust.

surreptitious,marked by quiet and caution and secrecy,"When someone behaves in a surreptitious way, they're being secretive. They're doing something that they don't want to be seen doing.","While surreptitious means secret, it has the added sense of ""sneaky"" or ""hidden."" During the Jewish Passover meal of Seder, an adult will surreptitiously place a piece of matzoh somewhere in the house for the children to hunt for later in the meal. You'll see surreptitious applied mostly to actions, rather than to things or ideas. We do things surreptitiously.

I was very surreptitious in how I organized the surprise party: she never knew!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/surreptitious
surrogate,someone or something that takes the place of another,"Someone who acts as a surrogate takes the place of another person. If a celebrity leaves her seat to use the restroom in the middle of a big Hollywood awards ceremony, a surrogate will take his or her place until she returns.","Surrogate comes from the Latin word surrogare, which means ""to put in another's place,"" or ""to substitute.""

synthesis,the combination of ideas into a complex whole,"Synthesis is the act of combining elements to form something new. If you describe your bedroom decor as a synthesis of vintage and punk, we'll know you mean a mixture of these two styles.","Synthesis can be either concrete or abstract.

taciturn,habitually reserved and uncommunicative,"Someone who is taciturn is reserved, not loud and talkative. The word itself refers to the trait of reticence, of seeming aloof and uncommunicative.

tantamount,being essentially equal to something,"When something is tantamount to another thing it is essentially its equivalent. For some animal activists, wearing fur is tantamount to murder.","Tantamount often refers to an action or thing being compared to another greater action or quality, as in, “Missing your finals is tantamount to dropping out of college.” While the two sides are essentially equal, you would not say, ""Dropping out of school is tantamount to missing your finals.” A related word is paramount, which means “the highest” or “primary.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/tantamount
tautological,characterized by unnecessary repetition,"Something tautological is redundant and circular, especially when talking about logic. ""Logical things are logical"" is a tautological sentence.","We use the word tautological for statements that go in a circle, like this sentence: ""A circle is circular."" This is a logical problem, because it doesn't make sense to define something in terms of itself. If you don't know what a fish is, then ""fish are fishy"" means nothing.

tenable,based on sound reasoning or evidence,"If your teacher says your position on the benefits of abolishing homework is not tenable, she means it is not based in fact. To be tenable is to be evidence-based and well-founded.","Tenable comes from the Latin root tenir which means ""to hold,"" as in ""hold together."" If your plan is tenable, it will probably hold together when you execute it, or hold up to scrutiny.

tenacious,stubbornly unyielding,"Use tenacious to mean ""not easily letting go or giving up,"" like a clingy child who has a tenacious grip on his mother's hand.","A strong grip or an unyielding advocate might both be described as tenacious, a word whose synonyms include resolute, firm, and persistent.

tentative,hesitant or lacking confidence; unsettled in mind or opinion,"Choose the adjective tentative to describe something you are unsure or hesitant about. On Monday, you can make tentative plans for the weekend, but it's too early to commit to one party or another.","Tentative, from the Latin tentātīvus, ""testing, trying,"" always describes something that is uncertain. If you make a tentative appointment, write it down in pencil, not pen, because it might have to be changed. Here the opposite of tentative is definite or set.

Polished language is neatly concise.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/terse
theology,the rational and systematic study of religion,"Theology is the study of religion, plain and simple. Of course, religion isn’t simple, so theology covers a lot of subjects, like rituals, divine beings, the history of religions, and the concept of religious truth.","Theology is taught to priests and ministers so they can better understand their religion, and it’s also taught in non-religious colleges to anyone who is curious about the ideas and effects of religion.

For example, a filmmaker's touchstone might be her all-time favorite movie; she wants her movie to be that good or similar to it in some way.","Touchstone as it is defined today comes from an actual stone. In the late 15th century, gold and silver was rubbed, or touched against black quartz — the touchstone — to determine the purity of the metals. This was done by looking at the color of the streaks left on the stone. This is why a touchstone, in the figurative sense as it is used today, is a measuring tool.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/touchstone

If you like to tout your skill as a skier, you tell people you can go down expert-level hills.","Sometimes parents will get into bragging wars about their children, each touting the accomplishments of his or her child.

transgress,"act in disregard of laws, rules, contracts, or promises","When you go beyond the boundaries, either physically or morally, you transgress. A river will transgress its banks as it floods, and students who cheat transgress school rules.","Transgress sounds like and means nearly the same thing as trespass. When you transgress a rule, you're breaking it. Religions often talk about transgressing: for Christians, breaking a commandment is transgressing against God by violating his wishes. Any transgression is pushing through a boundary: like a neighbor transgressing by letting their dog into your yard: that's a physical and a legal type of transgressing. The dog got into your territory, and the owners broke a rule.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/transgress
transient,lasting a very short time,"Use the adjective transient to describe something that always changes or moves around. If your older brother is constantly moving from city to city, you can say he's transient.","Transient is most often used to modify nouns like nature, threat, source and cause, which suggests that the word often shows up in formal contexts, like analysis of finance or global terrorism. But it can also be used for anything that moves quickly from one thing to another, like a transient feeling or facial expression. Transient is also a noun meaning ""a person who moves from place to place; a homeless person."" The word comes from Latin transire, ""to pass over,"" so you can think of it as describing things that are quickly passed over.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/transient
trepidation,a feeling of alarm or dread,"When plain old ""fear"" isn't enough to get across a deep feeling of dread about something on the horizon, use the more formal word trepidation.","""It was with a certain trepidation that I attended an advance screening of Rob Zombie's Halloween in Hollywood last night,"" wrote a film reviewer. Some dictionaries note that trepidation carries connotations of apprehension about an upcoming threat. In most cases, though, you can get by with the simpler word fear — why use three syllables when you could make do with one? The word comes from the Latin verb trepidare, ""to tremble.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/trepidation
turpitude,a corrupt or depraved or degenerate act or practice,"If you are guilty of turpitude, you should be ashamed of yourself. Turpitude is a word that represents depraved behavior. Prisons are filled with criminals who have engaged in acts of moral turpitude.","Turpitude comes from the Latin word turpitudo, which means ""repulsiveness."" Corrupt politicians get booted out of office for acts of turpitude, like taking bribes in exchange for lucrative government contracts. Turpitude often follows the word moral, and acts of moral turpitude are usually crimes that are unusually sick or corrupt.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/turpitude
ubiquitous,being present everywhere at once,"It's everywhere! It's everywhere! When something seems like it's present in all places at the same time, reach for the adjective ubiquitous.","""Cities like Singapore aim to cloak themselves in ubiquitous, free Wi-Fi in the next few years,"" The Wall Street Journal reported recently — meaning that those savvy Singaporeans will find a wireless connection everywhere they go. The word comes from the Latin ubique, meaning — you guessed it — ""everywhere."" The usual pronunciation is ""yoo-BIK-wih-tihs,"" but Joseph Heller must have had the older variant ""ooh-BIK-wih-tihs"" in mind when he wrote in Catch-22 that a character ""padded through the shadows fruitlessly like an ubiquitous spook.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ubiquitous
unconscionable,lacking a sense of right conduct,"Something that is almost unimaginably unacceptable is unconscionable. Think of it as being something that no reasonable person would even think of doing or saying — something unbelievable, outrageous, and often horrible.","The word unconscionable is related to the word conscience. Add the un-, and you can see that it refers to something done without applying good moral judgment. The word first appeared in the mid-16th century — presumably everyone up until that time had high scruples and never did or said anything beyond the boundaries of conscience. Sadly, the antonym, conscionable, is rarely used, and, in fact, has been obsolete since the 18th century, though unconscionable remains in frequent use.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/unconscionable
unctuous,unpleasantly and excessively suave or ingratiating,"You might know the idea of the adjective unctuous by other words like ""oily,"" ""smarmy,"" or overly ""flattering."" When a person is unctuous, you can't trust their kindness, because they usually want something in return.","Interestingly, unctuous is derived from the Latin unctus which means ""anointed with oil,"" which is where the oily connotation comes from. Unctuous and oily are synonyms that both suggest that someone is trying to butter you up; they're being nice, because they're hoping you'll give them what they want. Talk-show hosts, used-car salesmen, people who want your job: all of these are people we think of (rightly or wrongly) as being unctuous. Being an unctuous jerk, he gave me a gift, hoping I'd give him a record deal.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/unctuous
uniform,the same throughout in structure or composition,"Uniform means the same. If your school has a uniform it means all the kids wear the same clothes. If you are told to make your handwriting uniform, they want your letters to be the same shape and size over and over.","When you break uniform down, you'll see uni for one, and form, for shape––things that are uniform have the shape. If you are building a Zombie Army, it's more fun to create zombies who are not uniform. Some can wear shredded shrouds, others can wear whatever they find. Some walk just fine, others leave body parts wherever they go.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/uniform
unremitting,uninterrupted in time and indefinitely long continuing,"During a heat wave, it's not always the temperature itself that's a problem. It's that the heat is unremitting––you don't get a break from it. It's sweltering hot day after day after day.","You'd think the word unremitting would be connected to the word remit, but that's true in only a loose way. Remit means to send back––but if you remit a debt, you forgive it, or lift it. Unremitting describes something that is never lifted or sent back. Like the Energizer Bunny, it keeps coming and coming and coming.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/unremitting
unwitting,not aware or knowing,"Use the adjective unwitting to describe someone who doesn't know certain important information, such as unwitting computer users who don't know that an online shopping site is tracking all their activity.","Unwitting can also describe something you do almost automatically, like the unwitting way you double-check that the door is locked when leaving the house. It can also indicate that something is done without intention, like an unwitting arrival at a by-invitation-only event. Wit means ""clever,"" so something that is unwitting is not clever.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/unwitting
urbane,showing a high degree of refinement,"Urbane people are sophisticated, polished, cultured, refined. Spend enough time in an urban setting–-going to concerts and museums, spending time in crowds––and you'll be urbane too.","Both urbane and urban derive from the Latin urbanus, ""city,"" but while urban has connotations of gritty living and crime, urbane assumes that everyone sees the city from the roof deck of their penthouse apartment, drinking champagne and exchanging bon mots with friends. Add a Cole Porter soundtrack and the image is complete.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/urbane
usurp,seize and take control without authority,"If you take over your neighbor's backyard and claim his in-ground swimming pool as your own, you might seize control of, or usurp his yard, but he'll probably call the cops on you.","Leaders who usurp power don't ask for permission to take control of their country. They seize power, often with the help of a large army of followers. A usurper doesn't have to be human. A brand-new radio station can usurp the most popular station in town by playing a better mix of music.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/usurp
utilitarian,someone who believes that the useful is the good,The adjective utilitarian describes something that is useful or functional. If you are attracted to a car for its storage space and gas mileage — as opposed to its sparkly tire rims — then chances are you value a car's utilitarian features.,"The word utilitarian was coined by the philosopher and judge Jeremy Bentham, who argued that his principle of utility would create the ""greatest happiness for the greatest number of people."" The noun form of utilitarian refers to a person who adheres to this philosophy of usefulness. ""They couldn't agree on the decor for their living room. She wanted whimsy — delicate tables, fragile statues of fairies and unicorns, and cushions on the floor to sit on. He wanted something more utilitarian and useful — comfortable chairs, a giant TV, and sturdy tables to put your feet on.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/utilitarian
utopia,ideally perfect state,"Utopia is a perfect paradise that doesn’t exist, but which we all dream of anyway. In the dead of winter, we might imagine a utopia full of palm trees, warm breezes, and sun-soaked beaches.","Utopia didn't evolve from Latin or another old foreign language. Author Thomas More actually created the noun in one of his books to describe an imaginary island where all systems—political, social, and legal—are perfect and operate harmoniously. The definition of utopia was later broadened to imply any perfect place. The opposite of utopia is dystopia, coined in 1868 by J.S. Mill to describe an “imaginary bad place.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/utopia
abase,cause to feel shame,"To abase something or someone is to humiliate them — no, more than just humiliate them. If you abase another person you are bringing them low, humbling them in a mean, base manner. Not nice at all.","Abase means to bring someone down, often either in their job or their self-esteem. The early Latin bassus, which meant ""thick, low,"" evolved into the Old French abaissier, meaning ""to make lower in value or status."" The important clue to the word is ""base."" Consider that the base of anything is the bottom, and you get an idea as to the meaning of the word abase, which means to make someone feel low.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abase
abet,"assist or encourage, usually in some wrongdoing","To abet is to help someone do something, usually something wrong. If you were the lookout while your older sister swiped cookies from the cookie jar, you abetted her mischief.","The verb abet can be used to generally mean encouragement, but people usually expect to see it in relation to some crime. ""The singer was abetted by a pianist in her rendition of Silver Bells,"" for example, is a harmless construction. However, people more often expect abet in a sentence like this: ""She was charged with aiding and abetting the burglar because she drove the getaway car."" Abet comes from an Old French word abeter meaning ""to bait.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abet
abeyance,temporary cessation or suspension,"An abeyance is a temporary halt to something, with the emphasis on ""temporary."" It is usually used with the word ""in"" or ""into""; ""in abeyance"" suggests a state of waiting or holding.","The word abeyance has a legal ring to it, and for a good reason — appearing in English in the 16th century, it comes from the Anglo-French word abeiance, a legal term for waiting or hoping to receive property. Nowadays, the word is used in a similar way. Different legal rights, like property rights, can be held in abeyance until matters are resolved.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abeyance
abjure,formally reject or disavow a formerly held belief,"Abjure means to swear off, and it applies to something you once believed. You can abjure a religious faith, you can abjure your love of another person, and you can abjure the practice of using excessive force in interrogation.","Abjure is a more dramatic way to declare your rejection of something you once felt or believed. When you see its Latin roots, it makes sense: from ab- (meaning ""away"") and jurare (""to swear""). When you abjure something, you swear it away and dissociate yourself with it. You might abjure the field of astrology after receiving a bad fortune, or you might abjure marriage after a bitter divorce.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abjure
abomination,hate coupled with disgust,"The noun abomination means a thing or action that is vile, vicious or terrible. For example, if you see a neighbor kick an old blind dog that's done nothing wrong, you might remark, ""That kind of cruelty is an abomination!""","The word abomination comes from the Old French word abominacion, meaning ""horror, repugnance, disgust."" The word abomination can also be used to refer to a person or object you find utterly loathsome and repellent. If you look at someone else as an abomination, that means you are horrified by them, and barely even think they're human. If you hear a friend describing you as an abomination behind your back, you need to find a new buddy right away!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abomination
aboriginal,having existed from the beginning,"The native, indigenous people of a country are often called aboriginals. In Canada, the First Nations — Inuits and Métis — would be considered aboriginals.","The adjective form of aboriginal is used to describe anything related to the people native to an area. You may visit a museum that has an exhibit of aboriginal art; or, if you're a linguist, you may study aboriginal languages. The adjective can also be used to describe something that is indigenous to a place and existed there from the beginning, such as ""an aboriginal forest"" that consists of old, old trees.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/aboriginal
abound,exist in large quantities,"When things abound, there are a lot of them. In spring, birds, flowers, rain, and frisbees abound.","This word has to do with an abundance of something. In cities like Buffalo, NY, snow abounds. In very hot weather, insects and suntan lotion abound. Dogs are happy at the park when squirrels abound — meaning there are a lot of squirrels. On the moon, rocks abound, but that's about it.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abound
abrogate,revoke formally,"Abrogate means to abolish or avoid. When someone cuts in front of you in line, they are abrogating your right to be the next one served. When you cut in line, you are abrogating your responsibility to those who were in line before you.","The Latin root of this word is made up of the prefix ab- ""away"" and rogare ""to propose a law."" What does it mean if you propose a law away? You repeal it, of course, so abrogate means to officially revoke, cancel or abolish. The meaning of this word has expanded a bit since its earliest usage, but it still appears most often in a legal or political context, or when serious rights and responsibilities are being discussed.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/abrogate
accede,yield to another's wish or opinion,"If you accede, it means you agree with someone or give in to his or her wish. The word is often used in a political context — the Queen acceded to the Prince's demands for more territory, a larger army, and funnier jesters.","Accede can also be used for everyday situations. If you accede to your mother's request that you come home before ten, it means you'll be missing that midnight movie with your friends. Accede comes from the Latin accedere, meaning to ""approach or enter upon."" It differs slightly from concede, which also means consent, but a more reluctant kind. If you were to concede to your mom's 10 PM curfew rather than accede to it, you'd be doing so against your will.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/accede
accentuate,stress or single out as important,"To accentuate something is to emphasize it. If you want someone to know you’re from the American South, accentuate your accent by laying it on thick, y’all.","When you accentuate, you draw attention to something. You could wear a green shirt to accentuate your green eyes, for example. You can also accentuate words when you give them added stress. An actor might accentuate certain words in a monologue in order to emphasize the character's anger. This word traces all the way back to the Latin verb canere, ""to sing.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/accentuate
access,the right to enter,"Most libraries provide computers you can use to access the Internet. If chemicals are being stolen from a lab, you might ask who has access to the lab. Access is approaching or making use of something, or the ability to do so","Sometimes the word is applied to a person. If you work in the same room as your boss, you might have easy access to her.

Access is from Middle English, from Middle French acces ""arrival,"" from Latin accessus ""an approach,"" from accedere ""to approach.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/access
acclaim,enthusiastic approval,"You know you've hit it big when you earn acclaim, or enthusiastic approval. And when you have achieved ""critical acclaim,"" even the grouchy critics approve of you.","The word acclaim comes from the Latin word acclamare, which means to cry out.

""The book was critically acclaimed, but most of the students found it to be stupefyingly boring.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/acclaim
accord,concurrence of opinion,"An accord is an agreement between groups or even nations, like a formal peace accord that prevents war or the accord between you and your sister specifying who gets to use the car on which days.","Accord is an agreeable word. If you and your best friend are always in accord, you agree about everything. And if you do something of your own accord, you do it without prompting from someone else. As a verb, accord means to be in harmony or agreement, or to allow. Perhaps your enhanced vocabulary will accord you, or allow you, a better understanding of language.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/accord
accoutrement,accessory or supplementary item of equipment or clothing,"Does that shiny new car come with all the bells and whistles? Then it has plenty of accoutrements, or accessories.","Say accoutrement with a French accent and you'll be referring to an outfit — a particularly bizarre outfit. But when we borrowed the word from France, it evolved to refer to any kind of trappings or extras, especially clothing accessories. So an accoutrement can be anything from a belt or bangles, to extra cup holders and heated bucket seats.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/accoutrement
accrue,grow by addition,"To accrue is to accumulate or to keep growing in value or size. If you can accrue enough extra credit to build up your grade, you won't have to take the final exam.","Early forms of the word accrue were used as early as the 15th century with the meaning ""to increase"" or ""to grow."" Many modern uses for accrue involve money or finances, as when you accrue, or earn, interest on a bank account. You can accrue debt too, as interest grows on top of money owed until you pay it back. It's possible to accrue benefits over the time you work somewhere, or you can accrue demerits while you're misbehaving somewhere.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/accrue
acquisitive,eager to attain and possess material possessions,It may seem like your acquisitive cousin never talks about anything but shopping. Someone who's acquisitive is preoccupied with possessing material things.,"If you were trying to improve yourself by becoming less acquisitive, you might destroy your credit cards and force yourself to take a break from buying things. The adjective acquisitive comes from Latin word for ""accumulate,"" acquirere, so when you're consumed with accumulating more and more, you can describe yourself as acquisitive. It's an easy word to confuse with inquisitive, which means ""curious or inquiring."" It's much better to be inquisitive than acquisitive!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/acquisitive
acquit,pronounce not guilty of criminal charges,To acquit someone is to clear them of charges. Acquitting also has to do with how you carry or present yourself.,"If you're accused of a crime, then the best thing that can happen to you is being acquitted — that means you were cleared or exonerated of the charges. A defense lawyer wants to have his client acquitted. But watch out for another unrelated meaning: acquitting can mean how you behave, conduct, or carry yourself. If you acquit yourself like a champion, then you're acting like a champion.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/acquit
acronym,a word formed from the initial letters of several words,"Are the members of your after-school club tripping over the name Student Parachuting League & Aerial Team? Why not use each word's first letter to make an acronym, and call the club SPLAT? There, that’s better.","What do NASA, sonar, and scuba have in common? They are all acronyms. Not only does each letter come from the first letter of another word, but each group of letters is easy to pronounce as its own word.

adage,a condensed but memorable saying embodying an important fact,"An adage is a saying. Moms and dads love adages such as ""early to bed, early to rise"" and ""an apple a day keeps the doctor away.""","The noun adage comes from the Latin root aio, meaning ""I say."" Like a proverb, an adage can be true or not so much. It's a folksy saying that's been passed around for so long that it doesn't even matter if it's true anymore. Adages can be wise and wisecracking, such as this quote from Alice Roosevelt Longworth: ""I've always believed in the adage that the secret of eternal youth is arrested development."" There's a Book of Proverbs in the Bible, but adages can show up anywhere, even cross-stitched on a pillow.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/adage

If you were a lawyer, you might adduce, or bring forth, a witness in order to help your case. You might also adduce a piece of evidence, like a fact, to help with your argument. You might think of the word add to help you remember the definition of adduce: when you adduce something, you are adding to an argument by offering proof.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/adduce
adjourn,break from a meeting or gathering,"To adjourn is to close a session of something, like at court. People also adjourn when they go to bed.","When something is adjourned, it's over. This word comes up most often in court. Lawyers and citizens don't have the power to adjourn — to call a recess in the proceedings. Only a judge can adjourn the court.

See you tomorrow.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/adjourn
adjunct,something added to another thing but not essential to it,"Adjunct means something added on, but not part of the whole. An adjunct professor is someone who is hired by a college to teach but isn't a full member of the faculty.","This is a word you can figure out by taking it apart. From ad- ""to"" and -junct ""join"" (think ""junction""), you can see that this is about joining something to another.

aghast,"struck with fear, dread, or consternation","Would you be aghast, or shocked, to find out that your friends believe in ghosts, or would you share their frightened, or aghast, looks when a floating white being hovers over the campfire?","Aghast comes from Old English gasten, ""frighten,"" which comes in turn from gāst, ""ghost."" If you've seen a look of absolute shock or terror on someone's face — like when your mom (or dad) sees a mouse — you can describe the look with the adjective aghast.

alchemy,a pseudoscientific forerunner of chemistry in medieval times,"If your favorite but perpetually losing team picks up a couple of new players and the result is suddenly an unbeatable combo, that's alchemy — any seemingly magical act involving the combining of elements into something new.","In medieval times alchemy meant the mysterious science of trying to convert one form of matter into another using fire, potions, spells, and all kind of other tricks.

allegory,a short moral story,The figurative style known as allegory has nothing to do with alligators — unless you're telling a story where alligators represent evil forces snapping at humanity.,"An allegory is like a metaphor on steroids: a writer tells a fictional story where everything and everyone in it is supposed to represent a deeper meaning. Using a plain old metaphor, you might call death ""the grim reaper,"" but an allegory might build a whole tale of how the grim reaper goes around in a black cloak and informs people of their impending doom. Aesop's Fables are allegories, with animals taking the place of different human character types — though Aesop never wrote an allegory about an alligator.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/allegory
allot,"administer or bestow, as in small portions","When you allot something, you are giving out portions: “Becky was able to allot five snacks per employee, but in the afternoon some workers sneaked back into the break room for more.”","Be careful not to mistake allot for “a lot” (a large number), which has a similar spelling and the same pronunciation. Use the verb allot when you need to describe the act of assigning portions of something — be it snacks, time, or blame. The word is often used in the sense of an official group, such as a government or a corporation, dividing up and distributing small portions of something desirable, such as funding, shares, or land: “Zenitech Corporation was able to allot land rights to four groups in the area.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/allot
altercation,a noisy quarrel,"Altercation is a nicer word for ""quarrel,"" which is a nicer word for ""fight.""","Fight is a simple, effective one-syllable word, while quarrel is a softer, two-syllable word, and altercation is a very civilized-sounding four-syllable word for the same uncivilized thing: a noisy argument between angry people. Someone who gets a black eye fighting for a parking spot might — after cooling down — describe the incident as an altercation rather than as a knock-down, drag-out brawl.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/altercation
amass,collect or gather,"Amass means bring together or assemble. It can be a real shock to enter a room and see your amassed friends shouting ""Surprise!""","Although the word amass should not be confused with ""a mass,"" as in the thing you never want to hear has been found on your lung, they both derive from the Latin massa ""lump."" When you think about it, this makes sense. Whether soldiers or cancer cells, things that come together to form a whole — in this case, a tumor or an army — are amassed.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/amass
anathema,a formal ecclesiastical curse accompanied by excommunication,Something that one absolutely and positively cannot stand is anathema. Garlic is anathema to vampires (ditto for stakes and daylight). So is kryptonite to Superman or a silver bullet to a werewolf.,"Originally the term anathema comes from the Catholic practice of denouncing a particular individual or idea that was antithetical to the Catholic Church. If done to a person, it excommunicated them, meaning they could no longer partake in the church's sacraments (with presumably pretty poor consequences for the soul.) That's a lot worse than kryptonite.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/anathema
ancillary,furnishing added support,If you use the adjective ancillary to describe your position you are subordinate or supporting something or someone else.,"The adjective ancillary originally meant ""relating to maidservants"" from the Latin, but the element of a female servant has fallen away and now the word merely refers to a position as helpful or subordinate. An example of how something in medicine can be ancillary is after you have surgery you may also take a drug to aid healing — the drug would be considered ancillary to the surgery. One could also argue that in the United States the vice-president takes an ancillary role to the president.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ancillary
angst,an acute but unspecific feeling of anxiety,"Angst is a feeling of anxiety and frustration that isn't specific. People often feel angst about the state of the world, or about the state of their homework.","Angst is anxiety that is mixed with frustration and negativity. Angst often doesn’t have a specific target: people feel angst in general. Teenagers are known for their angst, which is shown when they act miserable about nothing in particular. Often, angst refers to philosophical displeasure with world events or personal freedom. An angst-filled person is dissatisfied and unhappy.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/angst
annex,attach to,"An annex is an extension of or an addition to a building. A small room off of a main room is an annex, and attics are another type of annex.","As a noun, an annex is part of a building or an addition to a main structure, or it can be an attachment, as in ""an annex to the current plans."" When used as a verb, the word means something a little different. Sometimes annex is used as a nice word for ""take"" or ""grab,"" as when Nazi Germany took the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in 1938 and added it to their own territory. In order to annex something to what is yours, you have to take it away from someone else.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/annex
annuity,income from capital investment paid regularly,"An annuity is money that comes from an investment and is paid out regularly over a fixed period of time. You can buy an insurance policy that is an annuity, or you can choose an annuity as one of your retirement fund options.","The noun annuity is from the Latin word annus, meaning ""year."" Indeed, annuities typically pay out on a year basis, although other terms are possible. If you win a large amount of money in the lottery, you can usually choose to take a lump-sum payment or smaller payments paid every year over some term, like 20 or 25 years. Figuring out which payment plan is best for you would be a nice problem to have!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/annuity
antedate,be earlier in time than,"When things antedate something else, they come before it, or happen earlier than it does. World War I antedates World War II.","Another way to say antedate is precede or predate. It's common to find the word antedate when people talk about history, for obvious reasons. Papyrus antedates modern paper, and paper antedates the desktop computer, which antedates the smartphone and tablet. Your parents' birth antedates your own, and your great-grandparents' lives antedate both yours and your parents'. In Latin, the prefix ante means ""before.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/antedate
anterior,of or near the head end or toward the front plane of a body,"The anterior of anything is the front — in humans, it's the area toward the head of the body, opposite of the posterior. Anterior can also refer to something that came before, as in ""anterior to the discovery of vaccines.""","The word anterior is one of those words that are spelled the same in English today as they were in their Latin origins. It still has the same meaning — ""former"" or ""before."" You can remember that by remembering that the prefix ante- means ""before."" Emily Dickinson once wrote, ""Love is anterior to life, posterior to death, initial of creation, and the exponent of breath.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/anterior
anthology,a collection of selected literary passages,A collection of writings is an anthology. The heavy textbooks that span the literature of an entire culture and that school children transport in over-sized backpacks with wheels? Those are anthologies.,"An anthology used to be just a collection of poetry, and the word came from the 17th-century Greek word anthologia for ""flower gathering"" or ""collecting."" A contemporary anthology can include anything from classic literature to rap music lyrics. Often an anthology focuses on one type, or genre, of writing, as in an anthology of horse riding haikus, or even an anthology of writings on writing. However, sometimes textbook-style anthologies — like Global Literature — will ambitiously try to include works from writers throughout the ages and from throughout the world.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/anthology
anthropomorphic,suggesting human features for animals or inanimate things,"Your favorite TV shows when you were a toddler probably had anthropomorphic characters like Thomas the Tank Engine or Arthur, who are non-human, but have human characteristics, such as human faces and the ability to talk.","You may have heard of anthropology, the study of human beings. Like anthropomorphic, it derives from the Greek word anthrōposi, which means ""human being."" One thing human beings like to do is anthropomorphize animals and inanimate objects. If that sounds fancy, just think about a kindergarten student putting a smiley face on his drawing of a sun.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/anthropomorphic
antipodal,relating to the antipodes or situated at opposite sides of the earth,"When things directly oppose each other, they're antipodal. Geographers use antipodal for places that are on the exact opposite sides of the earth from each other.","Parts of Spain are antipodal to New Zealand — in other words, if you drew a line straight through the center of the earth, you could connect those two countries. The Greek root of antipodal is antipous, ""with feet opposite ours."" You can also use this adjective figuratively to mean ""opposed."" If you and your brother couldn't be more different (you like vanilla, he prefers chocolate; you're a dog person, he loves cats), the two of you are antipodal.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/antipodal
antiquity,extreme oldness,"If you find an antiquity, call a museum: you just found something very old. Antiquity can also mean the idea of oldness.","The word antique should be a clue to the meaning of this word, which refers to things that are extremely old or ancient. This isn't grandparent old — this is really old, like hundreds or even thousands of years old. People also use this word to compare old ways of doing things to new ways: you could say an old-fashioned idea is an antiquity that goes against modernity (newer ideas and ways of doing things). Antiquity can also mean the time before the Middle Ages.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/antiquity
aperture,a natural opening in something,"An aperture is an opening, usually a small one. “If you can thread the silk through that aperture and pull it out the other side, we can knot it and create a loop.”","The most common place you’ll find aperture is when you’re talking about cameras or photography. In that case, an aperture refers specifically to the hole or opening in the lens that lets light through, which you can adjust (with the f-stop) to let in more or less light, resulting in a shallow or deep range of focus. A large aperture means only one tiny point of the photo will be in sharp focus, while a small aperture means that much of the background as well as the foreground will be in focus.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/aperture
apex,the highest point of something,"When there's no mountain left to climb and nothing but blue sky above, you know you've reached the highest peak — the apex.","Apex can mean the highest point in a literal sense, like climbing to the apex of the Eiffel Tower for a fabulous view of Paris. It also can be used to mean the highest point in a figurative sense. An actor who wins an Oscar can say she's reached the apex of her career. If you're describing more than one high point, you could add an -es to form the plural apexes, but apices would also be correct. And if you're a botanist, you'd probably use apex to describe the tip of a flower or leaf.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apex
apogee,the farthest point in an orbit around the Earth,"For an object in orbit around the earth, the apogee is the point that is highest or farthest from the earth. Early satellites had low apogees, so it wasn’t long before they burnt up in the atmosphere.","Apogee comes from two Greek words meaning “away” and “earth,” so it’s specific to things orbiting the earth. If you’re talking about something orbiting the sun, the equivalent word is aphelion, “away” + “sun."" Because apogee denotes the highest point something reaches in an orbit before falling back, it can also figuratively refer to other highs. For example, ""Child stars sometimes reach their apogee by 20, and there's nowhere to go but down from there.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apogee
apoplexy,a loss of consciousness from the lack of oxygen in the brain,"Apoplexy is a sudden and often fatal fit resulting from blood vessels bursting in the brain. The 19th century character Madame Bovary became a widow because of it. Today, we generally call it ""a stroke,"" but apoplexy sounds way better.","Although apoplexy as a specific medical term is not such a common term now, the word apoplectic certainly is, meaning furious and red-faced with uncontrollable rage (so called because its symptoms of flushed red face and loss of bodily control mimic those of apoplexy). Often used humorously — apoplectic is how you might describe your parents when they see your grades — though there's nothing funny about a real apoplectic fit.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apoplexy
apostasy,"rejecting your religious beliefs, political party or cause","If your lifelong Republican-voting grandfather suddenly decides to register as a Democrat, some of his conservative friends may consider his change in politics to be apostasy, or rejecting what has been a strong belief and adopting a new one.","When you abandon a set of beliefs, especially when they're religious beliefs, you can be accused of apostasy, which in some countries is actually illegal. It's taken seriously by many churches, since the rejection of a church's ideas can be seen as a criticism of the entire organization. Over time, the meaning of apostasy has grown to include non-religious examples, like your grandfather's political switch.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apostasy
appalling,an experience that shocks or offends,"Something that is appalling is awful or horrible, causing dismay or disgust. It's definitely not appealing.","Like so many things, people have different opinions on what is appalling. Most people find the idea of children living in poverty appalling. Just about everyone thinks a vicious ""sport"" like dog-fighting is appalling. If you're rich, paying a lot of taxes might be appalling. A football announcer might say that a sloppy play was appalling. Your parents might say the state of your room is appalling. This word can fit just about any situation that disgusts you.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/appalling
apparition,a ghostly appearing figure,"If you see something you think might be a ghost, you can call it an apparition to hedge your bets. Apparition doesn't commit you in the same way the word ghost does—and saying that you've seen one won't cause you to be committed.","Deriving from the Latin apparere ""appear,"" apparition was first used in 1520 in a religious context, referring to the moment when the three wise men appear before the infant Jesus in the Bible. Later, apparition came to include the appearance of ghosts, or ghostly figures. It can also mean a memory so vivid it's like seeing a ghost.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apparition
appellation,identifying words by which someone or something is called,Appellation means the name or title by which someone is known. Mark Twain is the famous appellation by which everyone remembers author and humorist Samuel Clemens.,"An appellation is what people call a person or thing — essentially, its name or title. George Herman Ruth's parents may have known him as George, but the rest of the world knew this famous slugger by his appellation, Babe. If you use the word appellation in a discussion of wine, you'd mean the name of the region or vineyard where the wine originated. Champagne is an appellation for the bubbly white wine that comes from the Champagne region of France.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/appellation
appendage,a part that is joined to something larger,Use the noun appendage to describe something that’s attached to something larger. Your arm is an appendage to your body.,"Appendage often describes body parts, either on humans or animals. If it’s something that sticks out — like a finger, tail, or leg — chances are it can be called an appendage. The word can also be used figuratively to refer to something that’s associated with something larger or more important, like a husband who’s a mere appendage to his famous wife. In this sense, the word takes on a negative connotation: the appendage is not important.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/appendage
apportion,distribute according to a plan or set apart for a special purpose,,,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apportion
apposite,being of striking appropriateness and pertinence,"Something apposite is fitting or relevant. It is apposite that radio stations play Christmas carols on Christmas Eve, and that your tax accountant takes vacation after April 15th. It all makes sense.","The adjective apposite is derived from the Latin terms appositus and apponere. Ponere means to place, and thus apponere is ""well-placed or well-put."" Don't confuse apposite with opposite; they have almost opposite meanings!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apposite
appraise,"estimate the nature, quality, ability or significance of","When you buy a house someone will need to appraise its value before you can get a mortgage. To appraise something is to figure out its worth in the marketplace, on the field, or in the world of ideas.","To appraise the value of a friendship is difficult, but to appraise the value of your grandfather’s pocket watch — just go to the pawn shop. The verb appraise comes from the Late Latin word appretiare, which means “value” or “estimate.” You can appraise your chances of marrying royalty, which are probably slim. You can also appraise the value of a quarterback on your fantasy football team by looking at the statistics for his completed passes.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/appraise
apprise,inform somebody of something,"To apprise someone about something is to fill them in, to give them the scoop. If someone in your immediate family wins the mega-bucks lottery, you want to be the first one to be apprised of that event!","Don't confuse the verbs apprise and appraise. Appraise means to determine the value of something — either its quality or its monetary worth. Apprise, on the other hand, means to inform or make aware. This word has a rather formal, weighty tone. Presidents get apprised of foreign affairs, but you will most likely not get apprised of weather conditions or dinner plans.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apprise
appurtenance,a supplementary component that improves capability,"Something that is an accessory to something but not an integral part of it is an appurtenance. If you buy a car, you may want to purchase a few appurtenances for it, like an ice scraper and fuzzy dice to hang from your rear view mirror.","The noun appurtenance does not only refer to tangible objects, such as appurtenances of a certain lifestyle. It can also mean equipment or gear for a certain task. By the time you fill your locker with all the appurtenances of a high school student, you won't have room for a coat. Perhaps the appurtenances you should invest in are heavy sweatshirts.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/appurtenance
apropos,"of a suitable, fitting, or pertinent nature","Apropos means regarding or appropriate to, as in: Apropos of your interest in fishing, your grandfather gave you his set of championship lures, rods, reels and lucky tackle box.","Apropos is a useful word to learn. But first you have to know how to pronounce it: AP-rə-pō. Then you can conveniently change the subject of a conversation by using the expression ""Apropos of nothing,"" which is a glib way of saying, ""Oh, and by the way..."" If someone's remarks are suitable and appropriate to the occasion, you can get on their good side by saying: How apropos!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apropos
apt,being of striking pertinence,"Something apt is perfectly appropriate, clever and well-suited to the matter at hand. If your room is small and dark, “cave-like” would be an apt description.","The wee cousin of aptitude, apt has the same root meaning of ""strength and ideal appropriateness."" An apt description or nickname is one that’s just right. Apt can also be used in the form ""to be apt to"" meaning ""to be likely to"" do something. You’re apt to use this word more now that you know precisely what it means!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/apt
arcade,a structure composed of arches supported by columns,"An arcade is a structure made by enclosing a series of arches and columns. The word's roots go back to the Latin word ""arcus,"" which means arc or bow.","An arched, covered passageway with shops or stalls on the sides is also called an arcade and was a precursor to the shopping mall. The Burlington Arcade in London opened in 1819 and was the first shopping arcade of its kind in Britain. It still exists and is the longest covered shopping street in England. As more of these shopping arcades opened, they also began offering games and eventually the word's meaning came to include video arcades, where you can play coin-operated games.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/arcade
archipelago,a group of many islands in a large body of water,"Now here's a word, archipelago, that is super-specific: it means a group of many islands. Wouldn't it be great to build your dream house in the Galapagos archipelago?","It seems that archipelago came from the Italian Arciplago, the name for the Aegean Sea, which is full of many many islands. Somehow that became the word for any sea that is chock-full of islands. You can also use archipelago to indicate some other grouping that involves neither islands nor water but is similar to them. Your little sister might create an archipelago of Lego buildings on your living room carpet.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/archipelago
archive,a depository containing historical records and documents,"An archive is a collection of older things — documents, books, movies, or something else — that's meant to preserve them. Archives tell us about history.","An archive involves old stuff — specifically, a collection of old stuff, often put together by a librarian. Newspaper archives collect old newspapers, usually all copies of a paper from a certain date onward. There are movie and music archives. Most museums have many types of archives within them. And it's always a good idea to keep an archive of important files on your computer. When you put something in an archive, you're archiving it.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/archive
arid,lacking vitality or spirit; lifeless,"Arid is so dry that nothing will grow. Death Valley in California features an arid climate, which is why it's called Death Valley and not Life Valley.","Arid can also mean terribly dull or lifeless. A textbook about the climate of Death Valley might be called arid if it's written in an uninteresting way.

armament,weaponry used by military or naval force,"Use the noun armament to talk about the kind of weapons that armies use when they wage wars. A tank, for example, is an armament.","The word armament is good for describing heavy duty weaponry and the equipment that's associated with it, like bombs, fighter jets, tanks, and assault rifles. It's even more common to use the plural form, armaments. In the seventeenth century, the word was mainly used to mean ""naval force equipped for war,"" and it comes from the Latin root armare, ""to arm, or to furnish with weapons.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/armament
armistice,a state of peace agreed to between opponents,"When two sides of a war need a break from killing each other, they agree to an armistice, a temporary battle timeout. An armistice isn’t permanent, but it’s usually a sign that both sides want to give peace a chance.","War is exhausting, and sometimes you need an armistice to catch your breath and figure out a more peaceful way to live. The word has two Greek roots: arma which means “weapons,” and stitium which means “stoppage.” When you’re ready to stop using your weapons, it’s time to propose an armistice. Although the word looks like a mouthful, it’s easy to pronounce if you remember that it’s an arm with two rhymes: ARM-iss-tiss.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/armistice
arraign,call before a court to answer an indictment,"To arraign someone is to call the person before a court of law to be charged. You've probably seen it in movies. It's the part where an official charge is read and the accused responds by saying ""guilty"" or ""not guilty.""","Arraign comes from Old French, but it traces back to the Latin ad, meaning “to,” and ration, meaning “reason or account.” So if you arraign someone, it’s like you're presenting an account — a record — of the thing the person has done wrong. You're outlining a formal charge in court. Arraign can also be used more broadly to describe any accusation of wrongdoing.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/arraign
arrant,complete and without qualification,The word arrant intensifies. An arrant criminal is one heck of a criminal. Arrant nonsense is total nonsense.,"Do you struggle for adequate superlatives? If so, you might want to add arrant to your arsenal. It can be used to add emphasis to other words, most often negative words. Arrant rudeness is extreme rudeness. Arrant hypocrisy is very hypocritical. An arrant liar is a world-class liar. Arrant has a meaning similar to complete or utter. Like other intensifiers, arrant turns up the volume on another word.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/arrant
arrears,an unpaid overdue debt,"If you are in arrears, you are behind in the payment of a debt. Think: rears=behind. Arrears also refers to the unpaid, overdue debt itself. Your rent arrears are the money you own on rent.","Arrears is a term often used in a legal context––like, when you've had to hire a lawyer because you're being sued by your landlord, or being evicted because you're in arrears on your rent. Before it comes to eviction, though, you should try negotiating with your landlord first. They would probably be more interested in collecting arrears, even late, than in evicting you and starting with a new tenant from scratch.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/arrears
arsenal,all the weapons and equipment that a country has,An arsenal is a storehouse for weapons. It wouldn't be wise to let your enemies get a hold of the keys to your arsenal.,"Not just a place to store weapons, an arsenal can be a place to make weapons or it can mean the collection of weapons themselves: ""The air force had just added two top-secret fighter planes to its arsenal.""

articulate,express or state clearly,"To articulate is to say something. And, if you say it well, someone might praise you by saying you are articulate. Confused yet? It's all in the pronunciation.","Reach for articulate when you need an adjective meaning ""well-spoken"" (pronounced ar-TIC-yuh-lit) or a verb (ar-TIC-yuh-late) meaning ""to speak or express yourself clearly."" The key to understanding articulate's many uses is to think of the related noun article: an articulate person clearly pronounces each article of his or her speech (that is, each word and syllable), and an articulated joint is divided up into distinct articles, or parts.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/articulate
artisan,a skilled worker who practices some trade or handicraft,"An artisan has both the creativity and the skill to make a product. Wandering around a local craft fair, you will often see artisans selling handicrafts like pot holders or beaded jewelry.","In medieval times, blacksmiths, carpenters, and masons were artisan trades. Unskilled laborers were not. The hierarchy of skill and prestige among artisans, from apprentice to journeyman to master, is sometimes reflected in ranks among today’s trade union members. But today an artisan can just be someone who makes attractive and creative work with their hands, like jewelry or pottery. Although, if they're trying to sell their goods, it probably helps if they're very skilled.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/artisan
ascertain,learn or discover with confidence,Ascertain is a verb that means to find out something. You might have to go to the bank to ascertain if there is any money in your account.,"This is a formal word that often applies to discovering the facts or truth about something through examination or experimentation. Information that is ascertained is certain beyond a doubt. If you want a less formal synonym, use discover.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ascertain
ascribe,attribute or credit to,"Ascribe means to give credit to, like if you ascribe the A you got on your group project to the hard work of your partners!","Ascribe's Latin root is ascribere, meaning basically ""to write in.'' Makes sense, because ascribe is often used to link writers to their words. Many a quirky quote, like ""Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter,"" is ascribed to that famous scribe Mark Twain. It can also be a way of blaming something — you might ascribe your bad attitude to your mom because she won't let you have cupcakes for dinner.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ascribe
askance,with suspicion or disapproval,"You may have trouble watching a gory horror movie, but you also won't be able to look away. Find a happy medium by looking askance, or subtly out of the corner of your eye.","First used in the 1500's, no one is quite sure where the cockeyed, slanting adverb askance came from. Some people suspect that it evolved from the Latin a scancio, meaning “obliquely, slantingly,” while others argue that it’s just a variant of the word askew. How fitting for a word that describes a suspicious or distrusting manner of looking that we can't trace its etymology with any surety.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/askance
aspersion,a disparaging remark,"An aspersion is a disparaging remark. It almost invariably appears as a plural, following the word ""cast"" — when you cast aspersions on someone, you are questioning their abilities or doubting them.","Finding out that a field-hockey coach had never played the sport might cast aspersions on her ability to coach it. Wendy's ads don't come out and say that McDonald's hamburgers are made out of cardboard, but through shot after shot of their own thick and juicy and oddly square offering, they cast aspersions on the quarter-pounder.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/aspersion
assail,attack someone physically or emotionally,"To assail is to attack or assault — with throwing stars, fists, words or, less tangibly but just as violently, with troubles or doubts.","Believe it or not, assail evolved from the ancient Latin word assilire, which means ""to jump on."" So picture an attacker jumping on you, throwing punches and maybe some insults, too. Because assail also means to ridicule or heap your worries upon someone. As novelist Charlotte Bronte noted, “Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last.” Think on that.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/assail
assert,declare or affirm solemnly and formally as true,"Asserting is all about standing up for what you believe. You might assert an opinion, your innocence, or even your authority over someone else.","The verb assert can be used for both opinions and for oneself. When asked, you can politely assert your desire to go to the amusement park for your birthday.

If that fails, you should just take yourself to the amusement park for your birthday. And get better friends.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/assert
assess,"estimate the nature, quality, ability or significance of","Before you try to sell your car, you should ask an expert to assess its value––once you know what it's worth, it's easier to find a fair price.

It also has a few specialized uses having to do with amounts of money, such as fines, fees, and taxes.

This verb came through French from Latin assidēre ""to sit as a judge.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/assess
astringent,tending to draw together or constrict soft organic tissue,"You know that vinegar-like liquid teens put on their faces in order to tighten their pores and dry up their pimples? That's astringent. An astringent personality, on the other hand, is perceived as bitter and perhaps even a bit toxic.","Astringent may be a lifesaver for an acne-prone teen, but when the term is used as an adjective and applied to you personally, it's less positive. Since astringents are acid-based, an astringent personality can also be corrosive. If someone is prone to biting sarcasm and cynicism, he probably has an astringent view of the world.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/astringent
asylum,a hospital for mentally incompetent or unbalanced people,"When someone needs a refuge from a difficult or dangerous situation, they need asylum. If a government offers to protect people who have fled war or hardship in their own country, it gives them asylum.","You may have heard asylum used to describe an institution where insane people are housed, but did you know that an asylum can also be somewhere you’d happily and willingly go? An asylum offers shelter and protection, like the awning of a building in a downpour.

Religious believers are known to atone for their sins, but even students can atone for a past failure by acing a quiz or two.","The word atone came to English as a contraction of the words at and one. The verb means to make amends or reparations for an offense or wrong doing. You can remember the meaning by thinking of it as a sort of Zen concept, to be ""at one"" or in harmony with someone, you have to atone for your mistakes and be forgiven. In a religious sense, it means to repent for sins (""to atone for his sins"").",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/atone
attest,provide evidence for,To attest is to prove or declare to be true. For example: the fact that you aced the SAT attests to the strength of your vocabulary.,"Attest and testify come from the same Latin word testari, which means ""to declare."" Although both words are kind of formal, you often testify in a courtroom, but attest doesn't require a court of law to function. You can attest to anything — that the funny looking shoes toned your thighs, that what someone says is true, or that the new acne medicine really works. To remember it, think of when you pass a test, you attest that you know the material.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/attest
attribute,credit to,"An attribute is a quality or characteristic given to a person, group, or some other thing. Your best attribute might be your willingness to help others, like when you stopped traffic so the duck family could cross the street.","Attribute comes from the Latin verb attribuere, which is made up the prefix ad, meaning ""to,"" and tribuere meaning ""give or bestow."" As a verb, to attribute is to give credit, like if you attribute the A on your test to all that hard studying. In Greek and Roman mythology an attribute will often stand in for a character such as Zeus's lightning bolt or Poseidon's trident.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/attribute
augur,predict from an omen,"To augur is to predict or indicate. A black cat passing in front of you is said to augur bad luck, but if you love cats you can choose to believe that it augurs good luck instead.","In the past, when you said you would augur the future it meant you would predict it. That form of augur is rarely used today, but the sense of prediction — connected to an object or event — remains. Dark clouds augur a rainstorm. If you skip a dress rehearsal before opening night of a show, it won’t augur well for your performance. The Latin root stems from an ancient Roman religious official who predicted the future from omens.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/augur
august,profoundly honored,August is not just the eighth month of the year; it also describes something esteemed or regal. The 200-year-old newspaper covering the royal wedding might be called an august institution.,"The month August was named for Augustus Caesar who was an important and regal person. This is an easy way to remember the two meanings. Interestingly enough, linguists think that the word august did not descend from the same root as the month August. Find that hard to believe? August sources disagree. Oh, and don't forget to pronounce each word properly — the month has the accent on the first syllable, the adjective on the second.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/august
auspices,kindly endorsement and guidance,"If an organization authorizes you to do a specific task, even if you don't work for them directly, you are working under their auspices. Auspices means endorsement.","If student volunteers are helping out with disaster relief under the auspices of the Red Cross, they may be registered with the Red Cross or be using their supplies and equipment. The Red Cross is not responsible for them as they would be for their own employees, but they have given the students their blessing.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/auspices
auxiliary,functioning in a supporting capacity,"When you're offering something in support of an already existing thing, you're offering something auxiliary. The auxiliary police will help out the regular police with things like directing traffic and crowd control when there's a special event in town.","The Latin word auxilium means ""help,"" and so auxiliary means something that ""helps"" by providing backup or support. Think of auxiliary verbs (sometimes called helper verbs), that provide support within a verb phrase, as ""is"" does in ""Helen is playing."" You can have an auxiliary engine in a car, an auxiliary cook at a restaurant, an auxiliary electrical network at a factory, or auxiliary troops standing by during battle. A ""Ladies Auxiliary"" functions as support for institutions such as churches, synagogues, or charities.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/auxiliary
avail,"be of use to, be useful to","To avail means to take advantage of an opportunity, the way you'd be crazy not to avail yourself of a chocolate milkshake on Free Milkshake Day at your local ice cream parlor.","Sometimes avail is used to mean ""help,"" and in that case it can be used in a sentence like ""Nothing seemed to avail me, not even winning the lottery."" More often though, avail shows up in the company of ""oneself of,"" as in the sentence, ""I hope you avail yourself of my advice, because I'm very wise."" It might seem like a complicated way to use a verb, but it's one you should avail yourself of if you're hoping to impress someone.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/avail
avant-garde,a creative group active in new concepts and techniques,"The term avant-garde refers to innovative or experimental concepts or works, or the group of people producing them. Pushing boundaries with his development of Cubism, Pablo Picasso was part of the early 20th-century art world’s avant-garde.","In French, avant-garde means the “vanguard” or the “advance guard” — basically the people and ideas that are ahead of their time. Usually it refers to a movement in the arts, like Dadaism, or in politics, like anarchism. Avant-garde can also be used as an adjective to describe something that’s cutting-edge. You might have enjoyed that avant-garde dance piece in which the performers threw marshmallows at each other, even though it was confusing at times.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/avant-garde
aversion,a feeling of intense dislike,"If you have an aversion to something, you have an intense dislike for it. Commonly it's food, but you could have an aversion to black and white movies, driving with the windows open, or taking calls from salespeople.","An aversion is also the person or thing that is the object of such intense dislike: her aversions included all kinds of vegetables and fruits. This noun is from Latin avertio, ultimately from avertere ""to turn away,"" from the prefix a- ""from"" plus vertere ""to turn."" Near synonyms are repugnance and antipathy.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/aversion
avert,turn away or aside,"To avert is to turn away or to prevent. You might avert your gaze or avert a disaster — either way, you are avoiding something.","The verb avert comes from Latin roots that mean ""to turn away from."" Averting has that sense of deflecting, turning away, or preventing something (usually bad) from happening. You might put salt on an icy sidewalk to avert accidents, or you might avert a toddler's meltdown by supplying a lollipop.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/avert
avid,marked by active interest and enthusiasm,"Avid usually means very eager or enthusiastic. If you're an avid reader, it means you read as much as you can, whenever you can.","But this adjective can also mean wanting something so much that you can be thought of as greedy. For example, a person can be avid for success or power. Avid is from French avide, from Latin avidus, from avere ""to desire, crave.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/avid
bacchanal,wild gathering involving excessive drinking and promiscuity,"A bacchanal is a crazed party with drunken revelry, ecstatic sexual experimentation, and wild music. In a nutshell, it is ""sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll.""","Bacchus was the Roman god of wine, which loosened the chains of social restraints; and so, the name of Bacchantes’ hedonistic, pleasure-filled gatherings were named bacchanals. Who might be a modern-day Bacchus? Elvis Presley had bacchanalian charisma. Now, this bit of trivia might impress your friends: the song we know as the Can-Can is titled ""Bacchanale,"" from the opera Orpheus in the Underworld – that’s one hot steaming club jam going on down in Hades!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bacchanal
baleful,threatening or foreshadowing evil or tragic developments,"Baleful means the foreshadowing of tragic or evil events. If no one's listening in class and your teacher reprimands you with a baleful glance, expect a pop quiz.","If your car breaks down and you take refuge in a deserted mansion, you might huddle under a dusty blanket and find yourself thinking that the wind moaning at the windows sounds baleful — maybe it's really the voice of a young woman murdered in the very bed where you sleep?",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/baleful
balk,refuse to comply,"If you balk at your mother's suggestion that you take on more responsibility, you're saying no to added chores. To balk means to refuse to go along with.","A donkey balks when it refuses to move forward. This is a good picture for balk which is often used in conjunction with demands. Demands are something people often balk at like a donkey refusing to move. In baseball, a pitcher balks when he or she begins a pitch by winding up, but does not complete it. It is as if he is refusing to complete a started pitch, and it is against the rules.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/balk
ballyhoo,blatant or sensational promotion,,,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/ballyhoo
balm,an aromatic resinous substance used for healing and soothing,"If your lips are cracked and dry, lip balm will make them feel better. A balm is a soothing substance with a consistency somewhere between solid and liquid.","The ointment-like consistency is part of what the word balm means. It comes down from the word, balsam, which is a gummy substance that comes from trees. You can use the word metaphorically too. If your mother's cooking always makes you feel better no matter how bad things get, you can say her home cooking has been a balm for you in trying times.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/balm
bandy,toss or strike a ball back and forth,"Bandy is a verb that means to toss many ideas around without focusing on just one. If you've ever brainstormed, you know what this is like — you bandy about different ideas until you find one that works.","Bandy also means to exchange blows, like in a professional fight. As a skilled heavyweight boxer, you are known to bandy with your opponent for several minutes before you knock him out. Bandy comes from the Middle French word bander which means ""to strike back and forth."" These days it's also used as a more general term to describe tossing or hitting any ball back and forth.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bandy
banter,converse in a playful or teasing way,"Good friends usually banter back and forth easily, like they're trying to keep a step ahead of each other in witty responses. This type of banter is their special language of friendship.","Banter is both a noun and a verb about talking. It comes from unknown origins, but even as a word, it seems to be playful and teasing. You can engage in banter with friends, siblings, parents, and even good-natured strangers. Banter usually ends with everyone feeling better for the talk and verbal play. Joking, joshing, and teasing are all related to banter.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/banter
baroque,having elaborate symmetrical ornamentation,"Something baroque is overly ornate, like a paisley red velvet jacket with tassels, or music that has a lot going on and might include a harpsichord.","Anything with a complicated design can be baroque but it also refers to a style of art, music, and architecture from 17th Century Italy (and is then sometimes capitalized). Although it has roots in the Portuguese word barroco meaning ""imperfect pearl"" not everything baroque is imperfect. Caravaggio and Rubens are considered baroque painters, and baroque composers include Vivaldi, Bach, and Handel. Although rococo and baroque both describe something over-the-top, sticklers will save baroque for something with heft and use rococo for lighter designs, like that velvet jacket. Historically, Rococo comes after the Baroque period.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/baroque
barrage,the heavy fire of artillery to saturate an area,"A barrage is something that comes quickly and heavily — as an attack of bullets or artillery, or a fast spray of words.","Sometimes in movies or news footage, the audience gets a glimpse from behind a mounted weapon and sees a heavy rain of bombs or bullets — called a barrage — going toward a target, sending as much POW! as possible to hit a wide area. Words become a barrage when spoken or written in uncontrollable anger or with overflowing emotion: ""Her human-rights speech was a barrage of passion. It was hard to keep up with, but we felt the intensity of her cause.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/barrage
bauble,cheap showy jewelry or ornament,"Baubles are trinkets or novelty items that cost little and aren’t very important or valuable, such as a plastic ring in the shape of a daisy that covers half of your finger in hot-pink plastic.","Baubles: the Mardi Gras beads you collected last year, the small statue of the Eiffel tower your grandparents brought back from Paris, those big glass bulbs you use to decorate a Christmas tree, a computer mouse made to look like a hamburger.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bauble
bedlam,a state of extreme confusion and disorder,"Bedlam is a scene of madness, chaos or great confusion. If you allow football fans onto the field after the big game, it will be pure bedlam.","The term bedlam comes from the name of a hospital in London, “Saint Mary of Bethlehem,” which was devoted to treating the mentally ill in the 1400s. Over time, the pronunciation of “Bethlehem” morphed into bedlam and the term came to be applied to any situation where pandemonium prevails. The trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange appears to be bedlam, but the traders insist it’s organized chaos.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bedlam
begrudge,be envious of or feel annoyance toward,To begrudge someone for something is to wish them ill for it or to envy them. Try not to begrudge his getting the promotion over you — he's been at the company longer.,"An understudy might begrudge the lead her role and even go so far as to put glass in her shoes so she can't perform. An easy way to remember the meaning of this verb is to note the noun grudge lurking inside it. A grudge is ill will that you hold toward someone: to begrudge is to hold that grudge. If you begrudge your friend his happiness because he got the nicer car, your friendship will suffer.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/begrudge
behest,an authoritative command or request,"Behest is an authoritative command or request. If your boss or principal asks to see you, you go to their office at their behest.","Behest rhymes with ""request"" and they almost mean the same thing, if you give your request a little authoritative oomph, just a tad bit of ""or else."" Another difference between these words is that you can't use behest as a verb: You can't behest someone. You act according to their behest. The root word here is the Old English hehaes, means ""a vow.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/behest
bemoan,regret strongly,"Some people love to complain, don't they? Complainers also tend to bemoan things, which can be translated to ""Oh no! Why me?""","A more casual expression for bemoan is to moan and groan. If you step in a puddle and get your shoes wet, you might moan and groan about, or bemoan, your bad luck to whoever will listen. Just about any bad or annoying thing can be bemoaned. In fact, people love to bemoan how much other people are moaning and groaning about things!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bemoan
benediction,the act of praying for divine protection,A benediction is a blessing — either a formal one that you might hear in a church service or an informal one that you might utter when you take any leap of faith.,"The noun benediction comes from the Latin roots bene, meaning ""well"" and diction meaning ""to speak"" — literally to speak well of. Although it is most often used in the religious sense of prayer and blessing — especially a ceremonial prayer at the end of a church service — it can mean any expression of good wishes. ""Good luck on the test!"" the mother cried in benediction as her son set off for school.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/benediction
benighted,lacking enlightenment or knowledge or culture,Being called benighted is much like being called naive. It means lacking in knowledge or understanding—the kind you might have if you were older or more sophisticated.,"Although it sounds a lot like ""being knighted"", benighted has nothing to do with knights and, in fact, includes the word ""night"" (as in the opposite of day) and not ""knight"" (as in ""of the Round Table""). One way to remember what benighted means is to think of a person ""being nighted"" or, put into the dark. A benighted person is in the dark about things: they don't know because they can't see. The Dark Ages are thought to have been a benighted time, full of primitive ideas.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/benighted
bestow,give as a gift,"When you present an honor or a gift to someone, you bestow it, which is the same as giving it, but often classier and more respectful.","Bestow comes from the Middle English stowen, ""to place."" Placing something really valuable or honoring in the hands of another, or conferring a position of responsibility on them, is to bestow it. For example, ""She gave her teacher a ceramic apple she had made, knowing that her whole class would bestow the big honor of Teacher of the Year later that day,"" or, ""The king praised her for working with the poor, and he would later bestow the medal of honor on her in a ceremony.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bestow
bilious,irritable as if suffering from indigestion,"If an unpleasant meal has left you feeling grumpy and looking green, you're bilious in several senses of the word. This adjective can mean both ""troubled by indigestion"" and ""irritable,"" and it can also be used to suggest a sickly green shade.","The wonderfully descriptive word bilious comes from the root bile, which is a foul green fluid made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder — a fact that helps us picture something described as bilious as being really foul. Because of the connection with bile, we often refer to something that's an ugly shade of green as being bilious. Of course, the word can also be more kindly applied to someone who has a liver or gall bladder disorder.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bilious
bivouac,temporary living quarters built by the army for soldiers,"If you ever draped a blanket over bushes or lawn chairs in the backyard and pretended to bunk down under it when you were a kid, you’ve made a bivouac — a temporary, makeshift camp with little or no cover.","Bivouac comes from the 18th-century German word biwacht, and originally meant a patrol of ordinary citizens who helped the town’s night watchmen. Nowadays, you’ll most often see it used as a noun, but it can be a verb too — and it's often associated with soldiers, though that’s not essential. If you tend to sleepwalk, you might not want to bivouac at the edge of that cliff; make your bivouac in the meadow instead.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bivouac
blanch,"turn pale, as if in fear","To blanch is to turn pale, usually as the result of a physical or psychological shock. Nineteenth century literary heroines were frequently blanching — before they fainted, that is.","Blanch has also taken on the more general meaning of to cause shock in general. A government can blanch at following through a particular reform, without the implication that an entire cabinet actually turned white. You can blanch an inanimate object, too, when you deprive it of its natural color. White toilet paper has been blanched by using bleach, for example, though environmentalists blanch at the thought.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/blanch
bland,lacking taste or flavor or tang,"When you have a nasty cold and you’re very congested, food can taste unappealingly bland. That means dull, flavorless, or just plain “blah.”","Bland comes to us from the Latin word blandus, meaning “mild, smooth, flattering, alluring.” Funny, because today you wouldn't say there's anything ""alluring"" about something bland. People still use bland to mean pleasant and tranquil, but it more often has a negative connotation. Use it to describe plain old oatmeal before you’ve added brown sugar and berries to it, or to depict the forgettable, uninteresting personality of the lunch lady who served it to you.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bland
blandishment,flattery intended to persuade,"When you hear a blandishment come your way, you may feel flattered, as that's what a blandisher intends to do. However, beware because that flattery may come with the underlying intention of persuading you to do something!","The noun blandishment is related to the old-fashioned verb blandish meaning ""to coax with flattery, or kind words."" A blandishment is often teasing in tone, and the intention to persuade is usually thinly veiled. Your brother may use a blandishment or two to get you to do his chores, and you're going to know exactly what he's after. But the saying ""You get more flies with honey"" just might hold true if you find yourself taking out the trash when it's not your turn.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/blandishment
bliss,a state of extreme happiness,Bliss is a state of complete happiness or joy. Marriage is often associated with this joyous feeling: people who are married and still in love are described as living in wedded bliss.,"Another common association is heaven or paradise, as in eternal bliss. Bliss is from Middle English blisse, from Old English bliss, blīths. The final -s in this Old English word is actually a suffix and the word itself is related to blīthe, the source of modern English blithe, which means happy.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bliss
bluster,noisy confusion and turbulence,"If you tell the captain of the basketball team that you're going to beat him at a game of hoops even though you've never played, you're speaking with a lot of bluster or false confidence and bravado.","Bluster can also mean a strong wind. On a blustery day, you'll see trees blowing and people holding onto their hats. When someone full of bluster is talking about how they can do something that you think they can't, they're blowing a lot of hot air in your direction. And coincidently, another name for that type of person is a blowhard.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bluster
bombast,pompous or pretentious talk or writing,"Bombast is a noun meaning pretentious or boastful talk. If your football coach is known for his bombast, he probably gives a pompous speech before each game about the greatness of the team and, of course, his coaching.","Originally, bombast was cotton padding used to stuff or pad things like seat cushions. The meaning was extended to include padded and overstuffed speaking or writing, especially speech that's pretentious and showy. Other words with bombast at their roots include the adjective bombastic and the adverb bombastically. For all your coach's bluster and bombast, he's a pretty nice guy — too bad his overblown rhetoric turns people off before they get to know him.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bombast
bon vivant,a sociable person who enjoys fine food and luxury,"A bon vivant is someone who's the life of the party, and who enjoys life's luxuries. If you're a bon vivant, you probably have an active social life.","A bon vivant enjoys fine dining and traveling in style — in general, he prefers the most luxurious experiences. Bon vivants are also known for their many friends and acquaintances, and their love of socializing. The phrase is French, meaning ""one fond of good living"" or ""one who lives well,"" from bon, ""good,"" and vivre, ""to live.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bon%20vivant
bona fide,not counterfeit or copied,"Something bona fide is the real deal, the real McCoy, genuine — it's not a fake or a counterfeit.","We talk about things being bona fide when we're interested in how real or genuine they are. A counterfeit hundred dollar bill is not bona fide. When you earn your college diploma you're a bona fide college graduate. If you spend your whole life studying music, you're a bona fide musician. The opposite of bona fide is fake. We also say people make a bona fide effort: they're making a true, sincere attempt to do something.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bona%20fide
boon,"something that is desirable, favorable, or beneficial","Boon means something beneficial to a specific person, entity, or cause. ""Getting called out of school on the day of the test was a boon for Sam, as he hadn't remembered to study.""","Boon derives from the Old Norse bón, a request for a favor. Think of a boon as a favor that no one has necessarily asked for, something extra. ""We'd just spent our last dollar on a cup of coffee so it was a real boon to find a ten dollar bill lying on the sidewalk."" Boon can also be an adjective for someone friendly and welcoming, as in ""a boon companion.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/boon
boor,a crude uncouth ill-bred person lacking refinement,"A boor is a crude, rude person. Boors lack sophistication and manners.","Boors are worse than boring; they’re offensive and repulsive. To be a boor is to be an obnoxious, unsophisticated oaf. A boor would swear in church. A boor would talk too loudly on the train. A boor would get too drunk at a wedding reception. Boors lack manners and taste. When a boor is around, other people want to leave. If you have self-control and culture, you’ll never be accused of being a boor.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/boor
booty,goods or money obtained illegally,"Booty is treasure — money, jewels, and the like — obtained by criminal means, especially plundering or pillaging. If you're in the Caribbean on vacation, you could spend some time looking for buried pirate booty.","Although booty originally meant stolen goods from war or pirating activities, the term is now sometimes used more generically to mean any riches or treasure. Although you may feel as though you plundered your own bank account to buy new clothes for yourself, all the booty you brought home from the mall might make you decide that it was worth it.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/booty
botch,"make a mess of, destroy, or ruin","If you botch something, you make a mess of it or you ruin it. If you totally botch your lines in the school play, you stammer and stutter your way through the whole thing.","Interestingly, the word botch originally meant the opposite of what it means today. The Middle English word bocchen meant to mend or repair. As a noun botch means an embarrassing mistake or something that is done poorly, especially due to lack of skill. If they've never painted before, your friends working on set design might make a complete botch of the scenery for the play, which might involve repainting the whole thing.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/botch
bracing,refreshing or invigorating,"Anything bracing is brisk and refreshing. A Mainer might consider a January swim in the Atlantic Ocean to be bracing, while her Floridian best friend may think she's crazy.","You probably enjoy the bracing sea air when you're on a sailboat, or the bracing hike you take up the side of a mountain. In both cases, you're filled with energy and feel fortified by the experience. The adjective bracing comes from the verb brace and its figurative meaning, ""to strengthen or comfort.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bracing
brandish,exhibit aggressively,"To brandish something is to wave it about aggressively, as one might brandish a sword or tennis racket (if it's a particularly intense game).","Brandish often implies that a person is wielding a physical weapon. In fact, brandish comes from the archaic French word brandir, meaning “sword.” However, it’s also possible to brandish objects that aren’t weapons. If you win a bowling tournament, for example, you might be inclined to brandish your shiny new trophy in front of the other competitors. Be careful, though; they might mistake your trophy for a ""brandir"" and respond accordingly.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/brandish
bravado,a swaggering show of courage,"If you act with bravado, you are making a bold showy statement. Picture a cowboy bursting through saloon doors in an old western, and you can picture bravado.","The noun bravado is derived from the French and Italian words meaning ""bragging and boasting,"" and it is related to the word bravo. Today, the word means an almost-over-the-top amount of courage, but it can also be used (often with the word false) to mean a false show of bravery: ""It was her first day in the classroom and she was almost shaking with fear, but with false bravado — she took a deep breath and turned to face her students — 20 kindergartners.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bravado
brawn,the trait of possessing muscular strength,"Brawn means muscular strength. Brawn is thought of as the opposite of brains, but let’s face it — people can be strong and smart! No matter how smart you are, though, you must have big muscles to have brawn.","The word brawn is from the Old French word braon, which means “fleshy or muscular part,” referring to a part of an animal that people cook and eat.

breach,"an opening, especially a gap in a dike or fortification","A breach is a violation of a law, duty, or promise. If you'd contracted to mow your neighbor's lawn and don't do it, he can sue you for breach of contract. Or he can mow the lawn himself.","Breach traces back to the Old English verb: brecan, ""to break,"" which is what breach really means — ""a breaking of something.""

bristle,react in an offended or angry manner,A bristle is a stiff hair — the kind men shave off their face or the kind badgers have all over. Bristle also means to get angry. Tell an animal rights activist you use a badger's bristle shaving brush and you'll get the idea.,"The emotional meaning of to bristle comes from the fact that most animal bristles used by man are so-called erectile hairs — the ones that stand up on the neck or along the back of animal when it's angry or surprised. A common word associated with bristle is hackle, another name for such erectile animal hairs. Thus the saying ""to get one's hackles up,"" which is pretty much identical to bristling.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bristle
bromide,a trite or obvious remark,"A bromide is a common saying or proverb that is obvious and not that helpful, like ""When life hands you lemons, make lemonade.""","Some people love to say things like ""Follow your dreams"" and ""Love takes hard work."" Such trite, clichéd sayings are bromides. A bromide isn't very helpful or specific, and people tend to say them over and over again. The word bromide comes from the chemical compound made of the element bromine and another metal. This kind of bromide was historically used as a sedative, a medicine that dulls your senses, just as figurative bromides are boring and dull.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bromide
brouhaha,a confused disturbance far greater than its cause merits,"Brouhaha is something that people think is really important that’s actually not important at all, like the brouhaha over some new celebrity gossip. Brouhaha seems like a big deal, but it’s a bunch of baloney.","Brouhaha has two meanings, and tons of funny-sounding synonyms. The title of the Shakespeare play gives one meaning: ""Much Ado about Nothing."" The brouhaha over the latest Hollywood comedy might make you never want to see it. It's just fuss and hullabaloo about a movie that can’t possibly be good anyway. Brouhaha also means a loud noise coming from all over the place, like the brouhaha after a sporting event: hubbub and katzenjammer echoing loudly through the streets.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/brouhaha
brusque,rudely abrupt or blunt in speech or manner,"If you ask a salesperson for help finding something and all you get in response is a brusque ""Everything's out on the shelves,"" you'll probably take your business elsewhere. A brusque manner of speaking is unfriendly, rude, and very brief.","Brush and brusque are not related, but they sound similar––when someone is brusque, you often feel that they are trying to give you the ""brush off."" Near synonyms for brusque are curt, short, and gruff. Brusque (pronounced ""brusk"") was borrowed from the French word meaning ""lively, fierce,"" from Italian brusco ""coarse, rough.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/brusque
buffoon,a person who amuses others by ridiculous behavior,A buffoon is someone whose ridiculous behavior is a source of amusement to others. People you might call a buffoon are a political rival or the guy at work who tells silly jokes at office parties.,"The noun buffoon has changed its spelling over the years, but not really its meaning. In Middle French, it was bouffon, which came from the Italian buffone, meaning ""jester."" The original root is the Latin buffare. Think of the stereotypical court jester, the person who makes jokes and falls about trying to make the king laugh — he's paid to be a buffoon.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/buffoon
bulwark,an embankment built around a space for defensive purposes,"A bulwark is a wall built for protection or defense. If you and your pals build a secret fort for girls only, you might want to build a bulwark to surround it — with a ""No Boys Allowed"" sign posted prominently.","A seawall that runs perpendicular to the shore is sometimes called a bulwark, because it defends the beach, not against invaders, but against beach erosion. Although the noun bulwark can refer to any fortified wall, it often specifically refers to an earthen wall, like a rampart. As a verb, bulwark means to fortify with a wall or to provide protection: ""The volunteers used sandbags to bulwark the levee in an attempt to prevent the flooded river from overflowing its banks.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bulwark
Byzantine,highly complex or intricate and occasionally devious,,,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/Byzantine
cabal,a clique that seeks power usually through intrigue,"A cabal is a secret plot, or a small group of people who create such a plot. Some conspiracy theories are based on the idea that governments worldwide are in the hands of a powerful cabal.","Cabal comes from the word cabbala (also spelled kabbala), which refers to a Jewish tradition of interpreting texts. Cabbala is often regarded as a secret and mystical practice and, as such, the word took on the additional meaning of “secret behavior.” Cabal comes from this sense of the word. A well-known cabal in 17th-century England was coincidentally made up of five members whose names’ initial letters spelled the word cabal. (Their names were Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale.)",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cabal
cache,a hidden storage space,"Cache sounds like what it is, a stash, and sometimes people — usually the criminal type — have a cache of stolen cash.","Often the phrase ""weapons cache"" is used of a bunch of hidden guns or weapons that have been hidden or stored away, which is logical, given that the French verb cacher means ""to hide."" Sometimes things aren’t really hidden but are stored away out of sight for use later. Computers even cache data and directories to retrieve when needed. So a cache is anything from a stash of cash to a store of information on reserve.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cache
calamity,an event resulting in great loss and misfortune,"Use the word calamity to describe an event that causes great harm and misery, or a general state of distress or misery: the calamity of war.","Near synonyms are catastrophe and disaster. The noun calamity is from Middle English calamytey, from Latin calamitas, a word which might be related to Latin clades ""destruction."" Calamity Jane was the nickname of a 19th-century woman living on the U.S. frontier. She claimed to have some very exciting adventures.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/calamity
callous,emotionally hardened,"A callous person is insensitive or emotionally hardened. If you laugh at your little sister while she's trying to show you her poetry, you're being callous.","Callous comes from the Latin root callum for hard skin. If you walk barefoot a lot, your feet will become calloused. We usually use callous in the metaphorical sense for emotionally hardened. If someone is unmoved by other people's problems, you might say he shows a callous indifference to human suffering.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/callous
calumny,a false accusation of an offense,Use the noun calumny to characterize verbal attacks that are meant to destroy reputations or friendships. You've probably seen political ads during election time that rely on calumny to move voters.,"Calumny comes from the Latin word calvi, meaning ""to trick, deceive,"" which is why it can also describe falsely accusing someone or quoting them out of context with the intent to do them harm. Some political candidates use this tactic against opponents in the hope that voters will be tricked into thinking that the accusations are true.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/calumny
canon,a body of rules established as valid and fundamental,"Canon (one “n”) refers to a collection of rules or texts that are considered to be authoritative. Shakespeare and Chaucer are part of the canon of Western literature, so you might read their work in an English class.","A canon can also be a body of work, like the Shakespeare canon, which includes all of the Bard's plays and poems. These days, many schools and colleges include more diverse and underrepresented authors in literature classes and encourage students to read works not included in the standard literary canon. The literary canon can change with time, and so can the cultural canon. Don't confuse this word with cannon with two n's, the big gun that shoots bowling-size balls at the enemy.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/canon
cant,insincere talk about religion or morals,"Cant is language repeated so often and so mechanically that it's essentially empty of meaning. Cant can also mean the specialized jargon of a particular group — like the ""cant of piracy"" (e.g., Ahoy! Lubber! Arrr!).","Possible sources for cant exist in both Irish Gaelic and Latin, and the meanings of both are similar: caint is ""speech,"" while cantare is ""to sing."" In broader English, the word was first used to mock the singing of monks (who makes fun of monks?). As it evolved, cant became the whining of beggars and then the secret language of thieves, and the negative connotations persist in modern usage. Just think of the clichés and catchphrases parroted by politicians during election season!",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cant
canvass,get opinions by asking specific questions,"A canvass is a poll, usually a political one. Around elections, political parties often canvass particular neighborhoods, looking for votes and trying to measure the pulse of the people.","You might think of canvass as the heavy cotton cloth that is pronounced the same although spelled with only one s, that is, canvas. Canvas is used to cover things, and a canvass serves the same sort of purpose. Before elections, politicians want to cover their neighborhoods and districts with canvasses, campaign workers, flyers and the like in hopes of securing votes.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/canvass
capacious,large in the amount that can be contained,"When something is really big and holds a lot it is capacious, like a woman's capacious purse that is so big, people mistake it for a piece of luggage.","Have you ever seen a Fourth of July hot dog eating contest? As you watch people wolf down 60 or more hot dogs in a matter of minutes, you must be thinking, ""Where do they put all that food?"" Well, it helps to have a capacious stomach. The suffix -ous adds ""full of"" to capacity; capacious is literally ""full of capacity."" If something is capacious, it has plenty of extra room.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/capacious
capital,assets available for use in the production of further assets,"Capital is the total amount of money (and things with a monetary value, like houses or cars) that a person or institution owns. A bank's capital might be in the billions, while your capital barely makes it into the hundreds.","Capital comes from the Latin capitalis, or ""head,"" which some would argue is the command center of your body. Because your head is so important, capital, as a noun and as an adjective, has come to refer to the primary or chief example of something — whether it's money, a letter, a crime, or the national or state seat of a government. It can be easily confused with the American word capitol, which refers to the buildings where government activities take place.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/capital
captivate,attract; cause to be enamored,"To captivate means to attract others, fascinating or enchanting them. Some people are able to captivate with wit and charm, others with physical beauty, still others with intelligence.","Notice the similarity between the verbs captivate and capture. Both come ultimately from the Latin captus ""taken captive."" Still, while both words mean some sort of hold on someone, capture sounds harsh, as though a trap has been set, while captivate is a softer, more attractive word that suggests there might be a willingness to be caught. Robert S. McNamara, a former U.S. secretary of defense, said, ""Coercion, after all, merely captures man. Freedom captivates him.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/captivate
carcinogenic,causing or tending to cause cancer,"Something is carcinogenic if it has the potential to cause cancer. Asbestos, a material that was frequently used for insulation, was found to be carcinogenic, leading to laws regulating its use.","To correctly pronounce carcinogenic, accent the fourth syllable: ""car-sih-nuh-JEN-ick."" Carcinogenic is related to the noun carcinogen, meaning ""a cancer-causing substance."" Both words come from carcinoma, or ""malignant tumor"" and -gen, a suffix that means ""something produced."" So something that is carcinogenic produces malignant tumors — cancer.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/carcinogenic
cardinal,serving as an essential component,"A cardinal is a bright red songbird, and the word also refers to the bird's crimson color. In Catholicism, a cardinal is a high-ranking bishop. In math, you use cardinal numbers to count. A cardinal rule is one that is central and should not be broken.","Okay, that's a lot of definitions. How exactly are they related? In most cases, cardinal means central or essential. It's a cardinal principle that you use it to describe words of behavior like rule or sin. In the Church, cardinals form the central governing body, and in math the cardinal numbers (one, two, three) are the numbers you learn and use first.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cardinal
careen,move sideways or in an unsteady way,"Whether it’s an unsteady ship, a speeding bus, or a person who is woozy, use the verb careen to describe something that’s teetering from side to side.","When the word careen first entered the English language in the sixteenth century, it was used to describe a beached ship that was turned on its side for repair. The word can still refer to making those kinds of nautical repairs, but now you’re more likely to hear the word used to describe something that is swaying from side to side. You may feel like a ship out of control if you careen madly through a crowd or if you careen down a steep hill on skis.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/careen
cartography,the making of maps and charts,"Have you ever tried to draw a map of your neighborhood? If you’re drawing your map to scale, taking into account every little hill and valley, you can appreciate the challenge of cartography, the science of making maps.","You may think cartography has gone the way of the dodo bird, now that we’ve got Google maps and GPS devices. You don’t have to draw maps by hand anymore, but you still need cartography skills to turn digital representations into something people can use with ease. While the word cartography dates only from the mid-19th century, maps were around for a long, long time before that. Cartography comes from the French carte, “map,” and -graphie, “writing.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cartography
cascade,a small waterfall or series of small waterfalls,"Think of a cascade as something suddenly falling, tumbling down in a rush.","The word cascade conjures up a vision of anything falling in a manner resembling a waterfall — think of a cascade of shining hair, a sudden cascade of tears, or the cascade of light during a meteor shower. The idea behind the word is of something falling in a progressive manner or a series of steps. A downward progression of musical themes can be called a cascade, as can the disastrous cascade of the tumbling price of a stock on Wall Street.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cascade
cataclysm,a sudden violent change in the earth's surface,"The hurricane battered the coast, causing the city to flood, and tens of thousands of people were stranded without food or water. When an event causes great suffering, we call it a cataclysm.","Cataclysm comes from the Greek word kataklysmos, which means ""a deluge or flood."" So saying something was “a disaster of cataclysmic proportions” is particularly apt when you're talking about a tsunami. Still, people use the word cataclysmic to describe non-watery disasters, too, like stock market crashes, painful breakups, and failed grammar tests.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cataclysm
caucus,a closed political meeting,The noun caucus is a closed meeting of members from the same political party. The Iowa caucuses get a lot of attention during the presidential primary season.,"Who knows how we got the noun caucus? One theory is that it comes from an Algonquin word that means an elder or leader of the tribe. Another theory is that the word comes from a social and political club in Boston in the 1700s that was perhaps named for the Greek word for drinking cup. However the word slipped into American English, today it refers to a closed political meeting, often used to choose party leaders.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/caucus
cavalier,given to haughty disregard of others,"Someone who is cavalier has a dismissive attitude and regards other people as inferior. If you think you know more than your teacher and never bother doing homework, your parents might complain that you are cavalier about your studies.","The word cavalier dates from mid-16th-century French, from the Latin caballus, meaning “horse.” If you have a cavalier attitude, you look down on other people — as if you are sitting on a very tall horse and other people are sitting down there on the ground.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cavalier
cavil,raise trivial objections,"If your only cavil to your family's trip to Disney World is that you don't like airline food, you're not representing the anti-Mickey side of the argument very well. A cavil is a small or petty objection.","Cavil is not a word that comes up all that often. You can replace it with the more commonly used word quibble and still have the same meaning. If you cavil over a restaurant bill, you argue about the minute, unimportant details of who owes what — like whether your portion of the bill is $10.00 or $10.17.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cavil
chaff,material consisting of seed coverings and pieces of stem,"The proverbial phrase ""separate the wheat from the chaff"" may not be terribly meaningful to you — unless you happen to be a grain farmer. The chaff is the husk surrounding a seed, the part of the grain that is generally thrown away.","In cereal crops like rice, barley, oats, and wheat, the seed — the part of the plant that we eat — is surrounded by a husk. This waste material has been called chaff since the twelfth century at least, but the word has a long history as a metaphor meaning ""objects and ideas of little or no value,"" as well. The Internet is full of misinformation as well as facts so you might have a hard time separating the wheat from the chaff. Their nasty comments are just a lot of chaff — don't even listen to them.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chaff
chameleon,a changeable or inconstant person,"Look closely at that branch or leaf — you might be able to spot a chameleon hiding. These little lizards are able to change color and adapt to their backgrounds, blending in to hide from predators.","The history of the word chameleon goes back to the Greek word khamaileōn, which meant ""lion on the ground,"" maybe because of the creature’s somewhat scary face, or maybe because the ridge around the creature’s head looks something like a lion’s mane. In Old French it became chaméléon, which stuck. Today there are two acceptable spellings, chameleon and chamaeleon. We often use the word today to refer to a person who is changeable or inconsistent.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chameleon
champion,protect or fight for,"A champion is a winner, or someone who's really good at something. If you are a champion chess player, you are a superstar! When crowds sing Queen's ""We Are the Champions"" at football games, they are celebrating the fact that their team won.","Champion comes from the Latin word campionem for ""gladiator, fighter."" Rarr! No need to grab your sword, but a champion is also a person who fights for a cause. If you are the champion of fundraising, you keep pushing to raise money. As a verb, to champion means to protect or fight for something. You champion your little brother by defending him against meanies — no matter what, you are always on his side.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/champion
channel,direct the flow of,"A channel is a passageway, a means of access for a thing, a communication, or an idea.","Think of a channel as sort of a tunnel or a funnel that moves something directly through. The noun channel can be used for many such avenues. It can mean a waterway such as the English Channel — the ""Chunnel"" is a tunnel beneath the Channel — or a means of accomplishing a goal, as in ""going through legal channels."" Use it as a verb when you channel your energies to achieve success.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/channel
chasteness,lack of ornamentation,,,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chasteness
cherub,a sweet innocent baby,"You might think of a rosy-faced child as a cherub, conjuring up an image of chubby, naked angels cavorting amongst the clouds. That image comes from the most familiar use of the word, which was to name an order of angels.","The image we have of a cherub, chubby-cheeked babies with wings, actually wasn't around until the Renaissance, when artists depicted the lower-order angels as children. Prior to that, the word evolved from the Hebrew kĕrūḇ, and was taken from the Aramaic kĕ-raḇyā which meant ""child-like."" It was this translation that encouraged the idea of a cherub as being portrayed as a child. The plural form, ""cherubim"" also follows the Hebrew grammar rule of creating plurals by adding the suffix -im.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cherub
chortle,a soft partly suppressed laugh,"A chortle is a joyful, partly muffled laugh. If you have a toddler, you will recognize the sound of a delighted chortle, sort of louder and a bit more raucous than a giggle.","In 1871, Lewis Carroll, who wrote ""Alice in Wonderland,"" coined the word chortle in the poem ""Jabberwocky,"" about a son who slays a monster and comes back to his relieved and happy father: ""'O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!' He chortled in his joy."" Experts consider the word a blend of the words chuckle and snort and the laugh itself is also a cross between the two. You may chortle in glee if you find out your work nemesis just got a new job in another office — out of state.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chortle
churl,a crude or uncouth person lacking culture or refinement,A churl is a rude or nasty person. The basketball player who's constantly jabbing opponents with his elbows and deliberately tripping them is a churl.,"Churl comes from the Old English ceorl, ""peasant,"" and originally that's exactly what it meant: a commoner, or person who didn't belong to the nobility. During the 15th century, the word became somewhat negative, meaning ""a low fellow,"" and by the 1800s it meant ""person inclined to loutish behavior."" Today churl is less common than its related adjective churlish, but it's still a great name for someone who's vulgar and mean.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/churl
chutzpah,unbelievable gall; insolence; audacity,Chutzpah means fearlessness. It takes chutzpah to stand in front of the whole class and announce that you are a better writer than William Shakespeare.,"Chutzpah is a Yiddish word meaning ""impudence or gall."" Bravery that borders on rudeness is chutzpah, which rhymes with ""foot spa."" If you have chutzpah, you say what you think without worrying about hurting someone's feelings, looking silly, or getting in trouble. A display of chutzpah is meant to make a statement, like the chutzpah of the girl who shaves her head in protest of impossible beauty standards.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/chutzpah
cipher,a quantity of no importance,"A cipher is a secret code, usually one that's created using a mathematical algorithm. Sometimes the message written in code is itself called a cipher.","Cipher comes from the Arabic sifr, which means ""nothing"" or ""zero."" The word came to Europe along with the Arabic numeral system. As early codes substituted numerals for letters to hide the word’s meaning, codes became known as ciphers. If you crack a cipher, you break the code and can understand the message. From its ""zero"" meaning, cipher can also be used for a person who has no influence or importance in the world.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cipher
circumnavigate,travel completely around something,"Circumnavigate means to travel around in a big circle. When you circumnavigate the world, will you do it in a boat or a hot air balloon?","Circumnavigate breaks down to circum-, ""around,"" and navigare, ""to navigate."" It was first used in the era when sailors were trying to find new lands they didn't know about, and so the ""around"" in question was the trip around the entire earth. We also use circumnavigate to describe going around something that's too hard to go through, like when you circumnavigate the massive crowds in Times Square on New Year's Eve.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/circumnavigate
citadel,a stronghold for shelter during a battle,"A citadel is a fortified structure designed to provide protection during a battle. So, back in the days when pillaging was commonplace, it was a good idea to know where your nearest citadel was.","Among the most historically famous citadels are the Acropolis in Athens and the Tower of London. Even though we're building fewer physical fortresses these days, citadel remains a useful word, particularly when you need to create a metaphor suggesting strength and safety. As poet John Keats wrote, ""[I]t appears to me that almost any man may like the spider spin from his own inwards his own airy citadel.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/citadel
clandestine,conducted with or marked by hidden aims or methods,"Use the adjective clandestine to describe something that is done in secret, like your clandestine attempts to steal your brother's Halloween candy.","Clandestine, an adjective imported from Latin, describes a secret, usually illegal activity. Often these things have to do with political and spy organizations. The CIA might run a clandestine operation to infiltrate terrorist organizations. Words with similar meanings include secret; covert, used especially for military matters; undercover, common in espionage; and surreptitious which emphasizes a person's efforts to keep something secret.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/clandestine
classic,a creation of the highest excellence,"The noun classic means something that's very high quality, particularly if it has lasting value. The pristine Model T Ford that you keep in your garage is a classic, but the beat up old Honda you drive everyday is not.","Use the adjective classic to describe something that relates to ancient Greece or Rome. You can enjoy the classic Greek pillars on the outside of your house but still appreciate the modern plumbing on the inside of it. Classic also means excellent, of recognized authority, or definitive. Classic literature, for example, includes authors like Mark Twain and Jane Austin.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/classic
cleave,stick or hold together and resist separation,"Cleave, a verb, has two very different meanings. It can describe cutting or splitting something apart with a sharp instrument, or — oddly enough — it can describe sticking to something like glue.","To cleave or not to cleave, that is the question. Cleave can refer to being in close contact, to staying really, really close to someone or something: ""If you are walking in the pitch-black woods without a flashlight, you want to cleave to the person in front of you."" On the other hand, it can mean to split apart with a sharp tool — which is not the action you want to happen while walking in the woods. We've seen that movie.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cleave
climatic,of or relating to weather in some location over time,"Anything that has to do with weather or other conditions related to climate is climatic. If you're worried about climatic effects on your skin, you are concerned about winter dryness, UV exposure and windburn.","The adjective climatic is perfect for describing anything related to a climate. You might read that climatic changes have led to shrinking glaciers and starving polar bears, just as your grandmother might talk every winter about the climatic difference from when she was a girl. Climatic comes from the word ""climate,"" which in turn has its roots in the Latin word clima, meaning ""region.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/climatic
cloister,seclude from the world,"A cloister is an enclosed garden, usually surrounded by covered walkways. Because such spaces are often featured in buildings that house religious orders, cloister can be used to mean ""monastery"" or ""convent.""","In enclosed religious orders, monks and nuns withdraw from society to devote themselves to prayer and contemplation. In order to provide them with access to the outdoors while protecting them from contact with the secular world, the cloister became a common element of convents and monasteries. When used as a verb, cloister generally loses its religious connotation and means ""to seclude"" or ""isolate."" Don't get a lunch detention or you'll be cloistered in the classroom while all the other kids are running around outside.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cloister
clone,make multiple identical copies of,A clone is an organism that's genetically identical to another organism. The clone of a sheep has the exact same DNA as the original sheep.,"While most people are fascinated with the idea of identical clones of animals — or even humans — it's much more common for a biologist to create clones of individual cells or molecules for experimental and other scientific uses. You can also describe someone as a clone if they act or look uncannily like another person: ""Your cousin is totally your clone."" The word clone was first used in botany, the science of plants, from the Greek klon, ""twig.""",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/clone
clout,special advantage or influence,"When you speak of someone having clout, it usually means that they communicate a sense of power or influence, particularly in the political sense. ""You’ll wanna talk to that big guy over there if you want me to let you in. He’s got clout.""","Clout can also mean to hit someone really hard — either the hit you give (“that’s a big clout he just landed”) or the act of hitting (“she clouted him with a baseball bat”). Of course, the sense of having power and the actual hitting are related, since clout is something to be wielded — either physically or figuratively. Note: it's not just tough guys who have clout. China is said to have ""growing economic clout,"" and Oprah is known to have significant clout in the media industry.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/clout
cloy,cause surfeit through excess though initially pleasing,,,https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cloy
coddle,treat with excessive indulgence,"While it is okay for parents to coddle, spoil, or pamper a young child, it’s a little unnerving when parents coddle, or pamper adult children. And downright weird when adult children wear Pampers.","Coddle is an old word. Originally, it meant to cook gently in water that is near boiling, as in coddling an egg. It most likely gained its association with pampering and taking care of someone via a drink made for invalids that was prepared by coddling. “Mollycoddle,” a synonym for coddle, originally meant a person who coddles himself, or an effeminate man.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/coddle
cogitate,consider carefully and deeply,"To cogitate is a fancy way of saying to think hard about. If you spend a lot of time figuring out exactly how your French teacher does her hair, you are cogitating in order to avoid conjugating.","Cogitate can be used both transitively or intransitively, which means you can cogitate on something, like your history project or your why your computer never seems to work the way you want it to. Or you can simply sit in your room and cogitate.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cogitate
cohort,a band of warriors,"A cohort is a group of people who are around the same age, like a cohort of college students who have similar experiences and concerns.","The word cohort was originally used to describe a military unit in ancient Rome. You can see how this retains traces of the word’s origins: cohorts are bound together by similar circumstances just like a group of soldiers in a military unit. Some language purists insist that the word only describe a group, such as a cohort of accountants, but it can also refer to companions or supporters, such as “Susie and her cohorts.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cohort
commemorate,be or provide a memorial to a person or an event,"To commemorate something means to remember something and by doing so to honor it, as in “We would like to commemorate his many years of past service by presenting him with this lovely gold watch.”","The word commemorate has a pretty clear echo of memory in it, so it can help to keep it in your mind just by noticing that. You might also notice that you’ve seen the word before, either in late-night infomercials or in various advertisements in magazines, when they talk about commemorative plates, or stamps, or coins: little things that are supposed to honor events or people by recalling them to our collective memory.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/commemorate
commiserate,feel or express sympathy or compassion,"When you commiserate with your buddies, you're sharing your lousy feelings. People who commiserate have the same negative feelings about something.","Take a look at how commiserate is built: it's from Latin ""com-,"" which means ""together with,"" and miserārī, ""to pity."" Put them together, and you get ""to pity one another, commiserate."" When you commiserate, you and your fellow commiserators talk about how badly you're all feeling. After the layoffs, we all went to the bar to commiserate.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/commiserate
commodious,large and roomy,"If your house has a big and comfortable living room, you could say that you have a commodious space for entertaining. Commodious means roomy.","Yes, you see the word, commode — i.e. toilet — in commodious. Both words once had the meaning of convenience attached to them from their Latin roots. Indoor plumbing is in fact convenient when you compare it with the alternative as is having room to spare. But that meaning was left behind years ago.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/commodious
compatible,able to exist and perform in harmonious combination,"A word that comes up a lot in discussions of both food and people pairings, compatible speaks to a person or thing’s ability to exist agreeably with something or someone else.","Use the word compatible to describe two things that work well together, like your Wii and your big screen TV, or peanut butter and jelly. You may have heard that opposites attract, but initial attraction doesn’t necessarily mean that opposites will be compatible in the long-term. Advised Russian novelist and philosopher Leo Tolstoy, “What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are, but how you deal with incompatibility.”",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/compatible
competent,"properly or sufficiently qualified, capable, or efficient","If you are competent, you have the necessary ability or skills to do something. If you can carry a heavy tray of food and store a table's worth of orders in your head, you are probably a competent waiter.","The opposite of competent is incompetent––an incompetent travel agent might send you to Bahrain when you requested Britain. But competent on its own can sometimes be a veiled criticism, with the implication that someone competent is just going to through the motions––you'd rather have someone inspired on the job. In legal language, competent describes someone who is able to take part in a trial or sign a contract.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/competent
compile,get or gather together,"When you compile something, like a recipe-book or a mix-tape, you put it together using things that already exist (recipes, songs).","Poetry anthologies, greatest-hits albums, and world-record books are all compilations, because they're made up of things that were originally published or released somewhere else. If you want to skip out on soccer practice one day, you might compile of list of excuses.",https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/compile
comply,"act in accordance with someone's rules, commands, or wishes","Comply is to act according to someone's wishes or rules. Although you might like to stay out with your friends, you'll have to comply with your parents' rules and be home by midnight.","Comply shares a root with the word, complete.
